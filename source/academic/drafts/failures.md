The discussion takes place in an imaginary class room. The teacher points out that we have been
trying to eliminate errors from programs for over 50 years now and the class discusses different
kind of errors and different strategies that have been developed over time to deal with errors.

A lively discussion develops between the pupils. Tau advocates that all errors must be eliminated
using formal proofs. Alpha and Beta believe that software is an engineering discipline that should
rely on testing. Epsilon argues that errors cannot be fully eliminated and we need to live with
them. Finally, live coder Omega embraces errors as the source of creative inspiration.
