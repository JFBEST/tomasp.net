We will use this relationship to reason about domain model and understand the differences between several possible representations.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/types-and-maths/distributivity.png" class="rdecor" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most amazing aspects of mathematics is that it applies to such a wide range 
of areas. The same mathematical rules can be applied to completely different objects 
(say, forces in physics or markets in economics) and they work exactly the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we'll look at one such fascinating use of mathematics - we'll use 
elementary school algebra to reason about functional data types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In functional programming, the best way to start solving a problem is to think about
the data types that are needed to represent the data that you will be working with.
This gives you a simple starting point and a great tool to communicate and
develop your ideas. I call this approach &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/type-first-development.aspx"&gt;Type-First Development and I wrote about
it earlier&lt;/a&gt;, so I won't repeat
that here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two most elementary types in functional languages are &lt;em&gt;tuples&lt;/em&gt; (also called pairs 
or product types) and &lt;em&gt;discriminated unions&lt;/em&gt; (also called algebraic data types, case 
classes or sum types). It turns out that these two types are closely related to 
&lt;em&gt;multiplication&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;addition&lt;/em&gt; in algebra...&lt;/p&gt;

I look at a number of easy to make mistakes when writing asynchronous code in C# and demonstrate that most of them would not easily happen when using F#.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in February, I attended the annual MVP summit - an &lt;a href="http://www.2013mvpsummit.com/about"&gt;event organized by Microsoft
for MVPs&lt;/a&gt;. I used that opportunity to also visit
Boston and New York and do two F# talks and to record a &lt;a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Tomas-Petricek-How-F-Learned-to-Stop-Worrying-and-Love-the-Data" title="Tomas Petricek (Channel 9): How F# Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Data"&gt;Channel9 lecutre about type
providers&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="#rf13041502"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;].
Despite all the &lt;em&gt;other activities&lt;/em&gt; (often involving pubs, other F# people and long 
sleeping in the mornings), I also managed to come to some talks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:379px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:20px;"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/csharp-async-gotchas/async-clinic.png" style="width:379px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One (non-NDA) talk was the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2013/02/20/mvp-summit-presentation-on-async.aspx" title="Lucian Wischik, Stephen Toub: Async Clinic"&gt;Async Clinic&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="#rf13041502"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] talk about the new &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keywords 
in C# 5.0. Lucian and Stephen talked about common problems that C# developers face when 
writing asynchronous programs. In this blog post, I'll look at some of the problems from 
the F# perspective. The talk was quite lively, and someone recorded the reaction of the 
F# part of the audience as follows...&lt;/p&gt;

It implements type providers for WorldBank, Freebase and structured document formats (CSV, JSON and XML) as well as other helpers. This article introduces the library and gives a quick overview of its features.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;img src="https://raw.github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data/master/misc/logo.png" class="rdecor" style="width:120px;height:120px;" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When F# 3.0 type providers were still in beta version, I wrote a couple of type 
providers as examples for talks. These included the WorldBank type provider
(now available &lt;a href="http://www.tryfsharp.org"&gt;on Try F#&lt;/a&gt;) and also type provider for
XML that infered the structure from sample. &lt;br /&gt;
For some time, these were hosted as part of &lt;a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fsharpx/"&gt;FSharpX&lt;/a&gt; 
and the authors of FSharpX also added a number of great features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I found some more time earlier this year, I decided to start a new library
that would be fully focused on data access in F# and on type providers and
I started working on &lt;strong&gt;F# Data&lt;/strong&gt;. The library has now reached a stable state
and &lt;a href="http://www.navision-blog.de/blog/2013/03/27/fsharpx-1-8-removes-support-for-document-type-provider/"&gt;Steffen also announced&lt;/a&gt; 
that the document type providers (JSON, XML and CSV) are not going to be available
in FSharpX since the next version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that if you're interested in accessing data using F# type providers, 
you should now go to F# Data. Here are the most important links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data"&gt;F# Data source code on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://fsharp.github.com/FSharp.Data/"&gt;F# Data documentation &amp;amp; tutorials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Data"&gt;F# Data on NuGet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before looking at the details, I would like to thank to &lt;a href="https://github.com/ovatsus"&gt;Gustavo Guerra&lt;/a&gt;
who made some amazing contributions to the library! (More contributors are always welcome,
so continue reading if you're interested...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few years, I finally managed to find the time to attend the 
  &lt;a href="http://www.2013mvpsummit.com/"&gt;MVP Summit&lt;/a&gt; this year. The Summit is
  an annual event where people who are active in Microsoft technical communities come
  to the Microsoft headquarters to learn about new things (and, of course, tell them 
  how they should be doing their job :-)). The Summit is a great place to meet interesting
  people (so if you're reading this and will be there, definitely get in touch!)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news - for those interested in F# - is that I'll be doing two F# talks on the way and we also have a new F# course scheduled for later in the year. &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/events-winter-2013.aspx"&gt;Continue reading to learn more!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcing: Literate programming tools for F#</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-literate-programming.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2013 17:35:36 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">This article introduces a new F# package that makes it possible to write literate F# programs that combine code with documentation.

&lt;p&gt;For some time now, I've been writing my F# blog posts (and other F# articles 
published elsewhere) by combining F# code snippets and Markdown formatting. In fact,
I even wrote a Markdown parser in F# so that I can post-process documents (to 
generate references etc). You can read about the Markdown parser in an upcoming
&lt;a href="http://manning.com/petricek2/"&gt;F# Deep Dives&lt;/a&gt; book - currently, it is available 
as a free chapter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Christmas break, I finally found enough time to clean-up the code I
was using and package it properly into a documented library that is easy to install and use.
Here are the most important links:&lt;/p&gt;

It allows adding custom operations to a computation expression block. This article shows how to define a custom computation for processing trees using zippers. We'll add navigation over a tree as custom operations to get a simple syntax.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the less frequently advertised new features in F# 3.0 is the &lt;em&gt;query syntax&lt;/em&gt;.
It is an extension that makes it possible to add custom operations in an F#
computation expression. The standard &lt;code&gt;query { .. }&lt;/code&gt; computation uses this to define
operations such as sorting (&lt;code&gt;sortBy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sortByDescending&lt;/code&gt;) or operations for taking
and skipping elements (&lt;code&gt;take&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;takeWhile&lt;/code&gt;, ...). For example, you can write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fssnip"&gt;
&lt;span class="l"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fstip1', 1)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fstip1', 1)" class="i"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fstip2', 2)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fstip2', 2)" class="i"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fstip3', 3)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fstip3', 3)" class="k"&gt;take&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l"&gt;3: &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fstip4', 4)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fstip4', 4)" class="k"&gt;sortByDescending&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fstip2', 5)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fstip2', 5)" class="i"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I'll use the same notation for processing trees using the &lt;em&gt;zipper&lt;/em&gt;
pattern. I'll show how to define a computation that allows you to traverse a tree
and perform transformations on (parts) of the tree. For example, we'll be able to 
say "Go to the left sub-tree, multiply all values by 2. Then go back and to the
right sub-tree and divide all values by 2" as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fssnip"&gt;
&lt;span class="l"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fsdtip1', 1)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fsdtip1', 1)" class="i"&gt;tree&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fsdtip2', 2)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fsdtip2', 2)" class="i"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fsdtip3', 3)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fsdtip3', 3)" class="i"&gt;sample&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fsdtip4', 4)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fsdtip4', 4)" class="k"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="l"&gt;3: &lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fsdtip5', 5)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fsdtip5', 5)" class="k"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fsdtip2', 6)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fsdtip2', 6)" class="i"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;) 
&lt;span class="l"&gt;4: &lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fsdtip6', 7)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fsdtip6', 7)" class="k"&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l"&gt;5: &lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fsdtip7', 8)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fsdtip7', 8)" class="k"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l"&gt;6: &lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fsdtip5', 9)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fsdtip5', 9)" class="k"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fsdtip2', 10)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fsdtip2', 10)" class="i"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;) 
&lt;span class="l"&gt;7: &lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fsdtip8', 11)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fsdtip8', 11)" class="k"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example behaves quite differently to the usual &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt; computation. It mostly
relies on custom operations like &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;up&lt;/code&gt; that allow us to navigate
through a tree (descend along the left or right sub-tree, go back to the parent node). 
The only operation that &lt;em&gt;does something&lt;/em&gt; is the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; operation which transforms the
current sub-tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just a brief introduction to what is possible, so let's take a detailed look
at how this works...&lt;/p&gt;

If you want to learn about the domains where F# is used (including finance, game development, machine learning and other) as well as about common programming techniques in F#, then the upcoming &lt;strong&gt;F# Deep Dives&lt;/strong&gt; book is the book for you!</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/manning-deep-dives/cover.jpg" class="rdecor" title="F# Deep Dives" style="margin-bottom:15px" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  The F# language has been around for longer than many people suspect. My &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsquotations.aspx"&gt;first, completely outdated,
  blog post&lt;/a&gt; was from May 2006. The Microsoft Research releases, sometime around 2006 were the
  first stable versions that gained some interest and slowly attracted commercial users.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed since the early days. F# now includes powerful features like &lt;em&gt;computation expressions&lt;/em&gt;
  and &lt;em&gt;asynchronous workflows&lt;/em&gt; and F# 3.0 comes with unique &lt;em&gt;type provider&lt;/em&gt; mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an increasing number of users from diverse domains: F# is used to model complex domains
  in &lt;a href="http://techmeshconf.com/dl/techmesh-london-2012/slides/TobiasGedell_EdenAnFWPFFrameworkForBuildingGUITools.pdf"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt; and science; asynchronous and concurrent features are used to write server-side components
  of &lt;a href="http://theburningmonk.com/"&gt;social games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trelford-functional"&gt;trading systems&lt;/a&gt;,
  but also in &lt;a href="http://techmeshconf.com/dl/techmesh-london-2012/slides/AdamGranicz_DevelopingAndIntegratingWebSharperApplicationsWithFacebook.pdf"&gt;web programming&lt;/a&gt;;
  the expressivity of F# is used by machine learning experts to
  handle dirty data or &lt;a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=293"&gt;classify XBox players&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, the &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F# Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;
  has been recently founded to support the collaboration between different commercial users, open-source 
  community and academia.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an increasing interest in F#, but many of those who approach it ask (excellent) questions such as:
  &lt;em&gt;"In what problem domains can I benefit from F#?"&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;"How do I use F# in finance/science/gaming or web programming?"&lt;/em&gt;
  and most importantly &lt;em&gt;"How do I approach different problems in F#?"&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Learn F# at TechMesh and SkillsMetter</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/more-events-autumn-2012.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Oct 2012 16:53:04 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">Looking for an event where you could learn about F#?

  In only two weeks, you can come to two-day &lt;a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/progfsharp-2012"&gt;Progressive F# Tutorials&lt;/a&gt;
  packed with tutorials for both F# beginners and experts. At the beginning of December,
  the &lt;a href="http://techmeshconf.com/"&gt;TechMesh Conference&lt;/a&gt; comes with three days of
  talks about alternative (and future) technologies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be speaking at both Progressive F# Tutorials and TechMesh and I'm also doing a tutorial
  at TechMesh, so if you want to learn about F#, type providers in F# 3.0 and financial computing

Yang talks about applicative functors. He mentions two equivalent definitions - the standard one used in Haskell and an alternative mentioned in the original paper. In this blog post, I describe some reasons why the alternative definition is useful.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent blog post, &lt;a href="http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/08/applicative-functors/" title="Edward Z. Yang: Applicative functors"&gt;Edward Z. Yang talks about applicative functors&lt;/a&gt;. 
He mentions two equivalent definitions of applicative functors - the standard
definition used in Haskell libraries (&lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt;) and an alternative that
has been also presented in the &lt;a href="http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.html" title="C. McBride and R. Paterson: Applicative Programming with Effects"&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt;, but is generally less
familiar (&lt;code&gt;Monoidal&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard definition makes a perfect sense with the standard uses in Haskell,
however I always preferred the alternative definition. Edward uses the alternative
(&lt;code&gt;Monoidal&lt;/code&gt;) definition to explain the laws that should hold about applicative 
functors and to explain &lt;em&gt;commutative&lt;/em&gt; applicative functors, but I think it
is even more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Monoidal&lt;/code&gt; definition fits nicely with a trick that you can use to 
&lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx" title="T. Petricek: Beyond the Monad fashion (I.): Writing idioms in LINQ"&gt;encode applicative functors in C# using LINQ&lt;/a&gt; and I also used it as 
a basis for an F# syntax extension that allows writing code using applicative 
functors in a similar style as using monads (which is discussed in my draft 
paper about &lt;a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tp322/papers/notations.html" title="T. Petricek and D. Syme: Syntax Matters: Writing abstract computations in F#"&gt;writing abstract computations in F#&lt;/a&gt;). And I also think that
&lt;em&gt;commutative&lt;/em&gt; applicative functors deserve more attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why type-first development matters</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/type-first-development.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Aug 2012 00:21:21 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">This article describes type-first development (TFD). A software development methodology that is quite common among functional programmers and uses types as a simple way of communicating ideas about program design.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/type-first-development/tfd.png" class="rdecor" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using functional programming language changes the way you write code in a number
of ways. Many of the changes are at a &lt;em&gt;small-scale&lt;/em&gt;. For example, you learn how to express 
computations in a shorter, more declarative way using higher-order functions.
However, there are also many changes at a &lt;em&gt;large-scale&lt;/em&gt;. The most notable one
is that, when designing a program, you start thinking about the (data) types 
that represent the data your code works with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I describe this approach. Since the acronym TDD is already taken,
I call the approach Type-First Development (TFD), which is probably a better name anyway.
The development is not &lt;em&gt;driven&lt;/em&gt; by types. It &lt;em&gt;starts&lt;/em&gt; with types, but the rest of the
implementation can still use test-driven development for the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article demonstrates the approach using a case study from a real life: 
My example is a project that I started working on with a friend who needed a 
system to log journeys with a company car (for expense reports). Using the 
type-first approach made it easier to understand and discuss the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, TFD is a very simple approach, so this article just gives a name
to a practice that is quite common among functional and F# programmers (and 
we have been &lt;a href="http://functional-programming.net/courses/"&gt;teaching it at our F# trainings&lt;/a&gt; for the last year)...&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>F# Courses and Talks for Autumn 2012 (I.)</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/events-autumn-2012.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2012 03:47:08 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">This article is an invitation to a number of F# events at the end of summer and during autumn.

&lt;p&gt;Similarly to the &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-autumn-2011.aspx"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;,
  I already have a number of F# events planned for the end of the summer and autumn that 
  I'd like to invite you to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/08/VS2012-Live"&gt;Visual Studio 2012 has been completed&lt;/a&gt;
  recently and it comes with F# 3.0. For me, this means two things. Firstly, it is the second
  Visual Studio version of F#, which means that functional programming is worth taking seriously.
  Secondly, F# 3.0 comes with &lt;em&gt;type providers&lt;/em&gt;, which is a killer feature for working with
  data. No matter if you're a C# programmer now to functional programming or if you're an F#
  user in the real-world, I hope you can find some interesting and useful event below!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two main things that I'm going to be involved in are SkilsMatter trainings in London and New York
  and a few events at the biggest functional conference (ICFP) in Copenhagen...&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>The theory behind covariance and contravariance in C# 4</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/variance-explained.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jun 2012 14:24:52 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">Covariance and contravariance are two useful features of generics in C# 4.0. Most of the time you don't see them. They just let you write code that you'd expect to work. Actually understanding how they work is more difficult. In this article, I explain that, together with some theory where the two concepts come from.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/variance-explained/icon.png" title="Category theory is sometimes called 'general abstract nonsense', but it can actually be useful!" class="rdecor" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C# 4.0, we can annotate generic type parameters with &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; annotations to 
specify whether they should behave &lt;em&gt;covariantly&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;contravariantly&lt;/em&gt;. This is mainly
useful when using already defined standard interfaces. Covariance means that you can use
&lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in place where &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is expected. Contravariance
allows you to pass &lt;code&gt;IComparable&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as an argument of a method taking &lt;code&gt;IComparable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. If you already learned about covariance and contravariance in C# 4, then 
the above two examples are probably familiar. If you're new to the concepts, then 
the examples should make sense (after a bit of thinking, but I'll say more about them). 
However, there is still a number of questions. Is there some easy way to explain the 
two concepts? Why one option makes sense for some types and the other for different types? 
And why the hell is it called &lt;em&gt;covariance&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;contravariance&lt;/em&gt; anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I'll explain some of the mathematics that you can use to think 
about covariance and contravariance.&lt;/p&gt;

The options include triggering the event directly, using thread pool and in a specified context.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I wrote quite a lot of articles about agent-based programming in F#.
Agents (inspired by Erlang) provide a great abstraction for writing concurrent and scalable
systems. They are a great fit for both server-side development (for example, handling 
a large number of concurrent requests), but also for user interface (for example, keeping
state in an application with background tasks and interactive interface).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing reusable agents, we usually encapsulate agent in an F# object type. The 
type provides methods for sending messages to the agent. However, sometimes the agent
also needs to report some state change that can be handled by another interested agent.
This is done using F# events. However, F# events do not specify threading behaviour, 
so there is a number of options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article (inspired by a recent email discussion), I describe three ways of 
reporting events from an agent. The options differ in what thread is used to report the
event. Choosing the right option is important as it affects scalability and simplicity
of your agent-based code.&lt;/p&gt;

platform and functional programming, which had a long tradition in academia. 
Many useful ideas or libraries in F# (like &lt;em&gt;asynchronous workflows&lt;/em&gt; and 
&lt;em&gt;first-class events&lt;/em&gt;) are inspored by research in functional programming
(namely, the work on &lt;em&gt;monads&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;continuations&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;functional reactive programming&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exchanging the ideas between the research community and the real-world is one
of the areas where F# excels. Indeed, the first applicatiosn of F# inside Microsoft
(in the Machine Learning group at Cambridge) were all about this - combining
research in machine learning with a language that can be easily used in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, F# and the F# users also made numerous contributions to the programming
langauge research community. Influential ideas that come from F# include 
&lt;em&gt;active patterns&lt;/em&gt; and the F# style of &lt;em&gt;meta-programming&lt;/em&gt; for translating F# to 
JavaScript). I think there is a lot more that the academic community can learn
from the F# community, so I'd like to invite you to talk about your ideas 
at two upcoming academic events!&lt;/p&gt;

examples of programming with asynchronous workflows using the &lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; construct.
Briefly, when matching on multiple asynchronous workflows, they are executed in 
parallel. When pattern matching consists of multiple clauses, the clause that matches
on computations that complete first gets executed. These two behaviours are 
implemented by the &lt;code&gt;Merge&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;Choose&lt;/code&gt; operation of joinads. Additionally, 
asynchronous workflows require the &lt;code&gt;Alias&lt;/code&gt; operation, which makes it possible to 
share the result of a started asynchronous workflow in multiple clauses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we look at the definition of the additional &lt;code&gt;AsyncBuilder&lt;/code&gt;
operations that enable the &lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; syntax. We do not look at additional examples
of using the syntax, because these can be &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-async-prog.aspx"&gt;found in a previous article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parsers can also implement the monad structure. In some cases, this makes the parser
less efficient, but it is an elegant way of composing parsers and we can also benefit
from the syntactic support for monads. In this article, we implement a simple parser

track organized by Charles Humble. Reactive and asynchronous programming was a topic that was repeated
a couple of times during the whole session - Sadek Drobi talked about &lt;a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/presentation/Non%20blocking,%20composable%20reactive%20web%20programming%20with%20Iteratees%20in%20Play2"&gt;non-blocking reactive web framework

simplest monads - the &lt;code&gt;option&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type. This is a slightly oversimplified example. 
The &lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; construct can be used to write patterns that specify that a monadic
value (in this case &lt;code&gt;option&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) should contain a certain value, or we can specify
that we do not require a value. When working with options, this means the same thing

This time, we look how to encode join calculus, which is an elegant abstraction for declarative concurrent programming.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Join calculus provides a declarative way of expressing asynchronous synchronization
patterns. It has been use as a basis for programming languages (JoCaml and COmega), but also
as a basis for libraries (embedded in C# and Scala). Using joinads, it is possible to 
embed join calculus in F# with a nice syntax using the &lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; construct. Formally,
join calculus does not form a &lt;em&gt;monad&lt;/em&gt;, but it can be viewed as a version of &lt;em&gt;joinad&lt;/em&gt;
as described in the &lt;a href="../pubs.html"&gt;first paper on joinads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programming model is based on &lt;em&gt;channels&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;join patterns&lt;/em&gt;. A channel can be viewed
as a thread-safe mailbox into which we can put values without blocking the caller. In some
sense, this is quite similar to &lt;a href="agents.html"&gt;F# agents&lt;/a&gt;. A join pattern is then a rule
saying that a certain combination of values in channels should trigger a specific reaction
(and remove values from the channels). The ability to match on multiple channels distinguishes
join calculus from F# agents.&lt;/p&gt;

In this article, we look how the "match!" research extension for F# simplifies writing agents. In particular, we can easily implement states that do not handle all incoming messages.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Another area where the &lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; syntax can be used is when programming with F# &lt;em&gt;agents&lt;/em&gt;,
implemented by the &lt;code&gt;MailboxProcessor&lt;/code&gt; type. Formally, agents do not form the monad
structure in a useful way - when programming with agents, we do not compose a new agents,
but instead we write code that (imperatively) receives messages from the agent's mailbox
and handles them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article demonstrates an &lt;code&gt;agent { ... }&lt;/code&gt; computation builder that can be used for 
implementing the body of an agent. Normally, the body of an agent is an &lt;em&gt;asynchronous
workflow&lt;/em&gt;. The code in the body uses &lt;code&gt;let!&lt;/code&gt; to perform asynchronous operations, most 
importantly to call &lt;code&gt;inbox.Receive&lt;/code&gt; to get the next message from the inbox. When the
agent intends to handle only certain kinds of messages, it can use &lt;code&gt;inbox.Scan&lt;/code&gt;. When
using the &lt;code&gt;agent&lt;/code&gt; builder, pattern matching on messages can be written using &lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; and
it is possible to write code that ignores certain types of messages simply by writing an
incomplete pattern matching.&lt;/p&gt;

In this article, we look how to use the &lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; notation for working with tasks. The examples include simple parallel map, but also more powerful speculative parallelism.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The implementation of joinad operations for the &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type is quite similar to the 
implementation of &lt;code&gt;Async&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, because the two types have similar properties. They both
produce at most one value (or an exception) and they both take some time to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like for asynchronous workflows, pattern matching on multiple computations using 
&lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; gives us a parallel composition (with the two tasks running in parallel) and
choice between clauses is non-deterministic, depending on which clause completes first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike asynchronous workflows, the &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type does not require any support for
aliasing. A value of type &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; represents a &lt;em&gt;running&lt;/em&gt; computation that can be
accessed from multiple parts of program. In this sense, the type &lt;code&gt;Async&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is more
similar to a function &lt;code&gt;unit -&amp;gt; Task&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; than to the type &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key difference between tasks and asynchronous workflows is that the latter provides
better support for writing non-blocking computations that involve &lt;em&gt;asynchronous&lt;/em&gt; 
long-running operations such as I/O or waiting for a certain event. Tasks are more
suitable for high-performance CPU-intensive computations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been following my blog, you've probably already heard of &lt;em&gt;joinads&lt;/em&gt;. It is
a research extension of F# computation expressions (or monads in Haskell). The extension
makes computation expressions more useful in domains like parallel, concurrent and reactive
programming. However, it can be used for any type of computation including, for example, parsers.
If you're interested in detailed description, you can find it in two academic papers that
I blogged about previously: &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx"&gt;PADL 2011&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/docase-haskell.aspx"&gt;Haskell 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extension adds a keyword &lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; - as the syntax suggests, it is akin to pattern
matching using &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt;, but instead of pattern matching on values, you can pattern match
on computations like &lt;code&gt;Async&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (or on other monadic values). Just like other features of
computation expressions, the &lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; syntax is translated to applications of several
methods defined by the computation builder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't say more about joinads in this post, because you can now easily try joinads yourself...&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>F# courses and talks (Winter 2012 and beyond...)</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-talks-courses-2012a.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2012 03:07:13 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">A couple of months ago, I posted a list of my F# talks and courses for Autumn 2011.

  in F# is a powerful way to implement concurrency primitives (like blocking queue), as well as 
  complex systems (like &lt;a href="http://www.trayport.com/en/joule/video"&gt;trading screens&lt;/a&gt;
  and &lt;a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/functional-londoners-may-meetup"&gt;market analysis&lt;/a&gt;).
  I also wrote a series of articles on this topic that &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273081.aspx"&gt;are
  available on MSDN&lt;/a&gt; and should be a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, I'll be doing some talks about type providers, which is an upcoming F# 3.0
  technology for accessing data. However, I also hope to find some time to look at other directions for F#,
  especially how it can be used in an online web-based environment, either using Azure or by translating F# to JavaScript 
  using a recently announced &lt;a href="http://pitfw.posterous.com/"&gt;open-source project named Pit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  The F# IntelliSense in Visual Studio 2010 still isn't perfect, but I think it is safe
  to claim that it is the best IDE experience for a typed functional programming language

In this article, we look how to solve the problem in F#. Using static member constraints, it is possible to write simple generic calculations and using the INumeric interface, we can capture numeric operations for a type and use them when implementing complex types such as a matrix.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Generic numeric code is some calculation that can be used for working with multiple different numeric 
  types including types such as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;decimal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; or even our own 
  numeric types (such as the type for &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-custom-numeric.aspx"&gt;clock arithmetic 
  from the previous article of the series&lt;/a&gt;). Generic numeric code differs from ordinary generic F# code such 
  as the &lt;code&gt;'a list&lt;/code&gt; type or &lt;code&gt;List.map&lt;/code&gt; function, because &lt;em&gt;numeric code&lt;/em&gt; uses numeric operators 
  such as &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt; that are defined differently for each numeric type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing simple generic code that has some type parameter &lt;code&gt;'T&lt;/code&gt;, we don’t know anything about 
  the type parameter and there is no way to restrict it to a numeric type that provides all the operators that 
  we may need to use in our code. This is a limitation of the .NET runtime and F# provides two ways for 
  overcoming it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="spaces"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static member constraints&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to write generic code where the actual 
    numeric operations are resolved at compile-time (and a generic function is specialized for all required
    numeric types). This approach makes resulting code very efficient and is generally very easy to use
    when writing a function such as &lt;code&gt;List.sum&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global numeric associations&lt;/strong&gt; (available in F# PowerPack) give us a way to obtain 
    an interface implementing required numeric operations dynamically at runtime. This approach has some 
    runtime overhead, but can be used for complex numeric types (such as &lt;code&gt;Matrix&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combination of both&lt;/strong&gt; techniques can be used to implement complex numeric type
    that is generic over the contained numeric values and has only a minimal runtime overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static member constraints are a unique feature of F# that is not available in other .NET
  languages, so if you're interested in writing numeric code for .NET,
  this may be a good reason for choosing F#. In C# or Visual Basic, you would be limited to the 
  second option (which can be implemented in C#). In dynamic languages (like IronPython), everything
  is dynamic, so numeric computations can work with any numeric type, but will be significantly
  less efficient. In the rest of the article, we look at the three options summarized above.
&lt;/p&gt;

We'll create a numeric type representing numbers in a clock artihmetic (with base 5) and we'll see how to define custom operators, numeric literals and how to support F# PowerPack matrices.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we define an F# numeric type for calculating in the modular arithmetic (also called clock arithmetic)
  [&lt;a href="#ppcnuml"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;].  
  Modular arithmetic is used for calculations where we want to keep a value within a specified range by counting in cycles. 
  For example, a maximal value on clock is 12 hours. When we add 11 hours and 3 hours, the value overflows and the result is 
  2 hours. Aside from clocks, this numeric system is also essential in cryptography or, for example, in music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial shows several techniques that are essential when defining any new numeric type in F#. Most importantly, you’ll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a numeric type with overloaded operators &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a numeric literal for constructing numbers of our new type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable calculating with our type in F# lists and matrices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hide implementation details of a numeric type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define type &lt;code&gt;IntegerZ5&lt;/code&gt; that implements modular arithmetic with modulus 5, meaning that valid values are in the range 
  from 0 to 4 and we equip the type with operations such as addition and multiplication. When an operation produces a value that would 
  be outside of the range, we adjust it by adding or subtracting the modulus (in our case 5). Here are some examples of calculations 
  that we’ll be able to write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
2 + 1 = 3 (mod 5)
4 * 2 = 3 (mod 5)
List.sum [ 0; 1; 2; 3 ] = 1 (mod 5)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first case, we can perform the operation without any adjustments. In the second case, we multiply 4 by 2 and get 8 as the 
  result, which is out of the required range. To correct it, we calculate the remainder after a division by 5 (written as &lt;code&gt;8 % 5&lt;/code&gt; in F#), 
  which gives us 3. Finally, the last example shows that we’d also like to be able to use our type with lists. If we add values 0, 1, 2
  and 3, we get 6 which is adjusted to 1.&lt;/p&gt;

  numeric types that are available in F# PowerPack. Aside from these two, the PowerPack 
  library also contains a type &lt;code&gt;matrix&lt;/code&gt; representing a two-dimensional matrix
  of floating-point values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, you'll learn how to work with matrices in F#, using some 
  of the functions provided by F# PowerPack. I'll demonstrate the library using an 
  example that represents &lt;em&gt;graphs&lt;/em&gt; using a, so called, &lt;em&gt;adjacency matrix&lt;/em&gt;.
  If you're not familiar with this concept, you don't need to worry. It is quite simple
  and it will be clear once we look at an example.
  The matrix represents which vertices of a graph are connected with other vertices by 
  an edge. Many of the standard operations on matrices are useful when working with 
  adjacency matrix, so this tutorial will cover the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating matrices from lists and using functions from the &lt;code&gt;Matrix&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using slices to read or modify a part of matrix&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Performing standard operations with matrices such as transposition and matrix multiplication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using higher order functions for working with matrices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is the first article of a series where I'll explain some of the
  F# features that are useful for numeric computing as well as some functionality from 
  the F# PowerPack library. Most of the content was originally written for 
  the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273075.aspx"&gt;Numerical Computing in F#&lt;/a&gt; chapter on MSDN (that I 
  &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/real-world-book-msdn.aspx"&gt;announced earlier&lt;/a&gt;), 
  but then we decided to focus on using F# with third party libraries that provide more
  efficient implementation and richer set of standard numeric functionality that's 
  needed when implementing machine learning and probabilistic algorithms or performing 
  statistical analysis. If you're interested in these topics, then the last section 
  (below) gives links to the important MSDN articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, F# PowerPack still contains some useful functionality. It includes two
  additional numeric types and an implementation of matrix that integrates nicely
  with F#. The series also demonstrates how to use features of the F# language 
  (and core libraries) to write numeric code elegantly. In particular, we'll use the
  following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="spaces"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overloaded operators.&lt;/strong&gt; Any type can provide overloaded version of standard numeric 
    operators such as +, -, * and / as well as other non-standard operators (such as .*). 
    As a result, libraries can implement their own numeric types which are 
    indistinguishable from built-in types such as int.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numeric literals.&lt;/strong&gt; F# math libraries can enable using new numeric literals in the code. For example, you can 
    write a &lt;code&gt;BigRational&lt;/code&gt; value representing one third as &lt;code&gt;1N/3N&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; suffix used in the 
    notation is not hardcoded in the F# language and we'll see how to define similar 
    numeric type.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static constraints.&lt;/strong&gt; F# supports static member constraints, which can be used for writing functions that 
    work with any numeric type. For example, the &lt;code&gt;List.sum&lt;/code&gt; function uses this feature. It 
    can sum elements of any list containing numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These are just a few of the F# language features that are useful when writing numeric code, but
there are many others. The usual F# development style using interactive tools, type safety that
prevents common errors, units of measure as well the expressivity of F# make it a great tool for
writing numeric code. For more information, take a look at the MSDN overview article 
&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh304366.aspx"&gt;Writing Succinct and Correct Numerical Computations with F#&lt;/a&gt;.

If you want to learn about functional and asynchronous programming, F# and more, you may want to come to our training (organized with SkillsMatter), tutorials or some community events.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/autumn-2011-talks/tomas.jpg" class="rdecor" title="Tomas speaking at the Functional Programming eXchange 2011" style="margin-bottom:15px" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the summer holiday season is getting closer. Luckily, I was in Prague last
week so I actually noticed there was summer this year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few quiet months, the autumn is going to be quite busy.
  Microsoft's &lt;a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/"&gt;//build/&lt;/a&gt;
  conference will reveal the future of software development for Windows,
  but great things are going on in the F# world too. Don Syme is going to talk about 
  &lt;a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/fsharp3"&gt;F# Information Rich Programming&lt;/a&gt;
  at Progressive F# Tutorials in November, which should reveal more about F# 3.0 and type providers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have quite a few speaking engagements planned already, so
  if you want to learn about functional programming in .NET (and become a better
  C# programmer) or about F# and asynchronous programming,
  here are a few events that you may be interested in...&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>Programming with F# asynchronous sequences</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/async-sequences.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2011 23:30:57 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">Asynchronous sequences provide a way to represent asynchronous computation that generates multiple values on demand. This article defines asynchronous sequences, combinators for working with them and "asyncSeq" computation builder. Then it implements several examples including a sequential asynchronous Web Crawler.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/async-sequences/decor.png" class="rdecor" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In F#, we can represent asynchronous operations that do not block threads and eventually
  return a value of type &lt;code&gt;'T&lt;/code&gt; using asynchronous workflows &lt;code&gt;Async&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
  Asynchronous workflows can be easily constructed using the computation expression syntax
  &lt;code&gt;async { ... }&lt;/code&gt; and there are also a few combi­nators that express more advanced
  composition (such as parallel composition or fork-join parallelism).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we need to use asynchronous operations that return more than just one value.
  For example, when downloading data from the internet, we would like to create an 
  &lt;em&gt;asynchronous sequence&lt;/em&gt; that returns the data in chunks as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to represent asynchronous operations that produce multiple values is to use 
  the &lt;code&gt;IObservable&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type from .NET. This isn't always the best option 
  though. Observables implement &lt;em&gt;push-based&lt;/em&gt; model, which means that chunks of data are
  generated as quickly as possible (until all chunks are emitted). What if we wanted to take 
  the chunks one-by-one after the previous chunk is processed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I describe &lt;em&gt;asynchronous sequences&lt;/em&gt;. An asynchronous sequence is a simple,
  yet very powerful concept based on asynchronous workflows. It follows the same core model: results 
  are generated on demand and asynchronously. Unlike asynchronous workflows, asynchronous sequences
  can be called (on demand) to generate multiple values until the end of the sequence is reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style:italic"&gt;I first discussed asynchronous sequences with Don Syme, Dmitry Lomov and Brian McNamara in an
  email thread a long time ago. Thanks to Don for enthusiasm about the concept and for the 
  first implementation of some of the combinators!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show that joinads work in the pure setting, I created a Haskell version of the idea.
  The implementation (available below) is quite simple and consists of a pre-processor for 
  Haskell source files and numerous examples. However, more important part of the recent work of 
  joinads is a more detailed theoretical background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory of joinads, together with the language design of Haskell extension that implements
  it is discussed in a paper &lt;em&gt;Extending Monads with Pattern Matching&lt;/em&gt;, which was accepted
  for publication at the &lt;a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2011/index.html"&gt;Haskell 
  Symposium 2011&lt;/a&gt;. Here is the abstract of the paper:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;"&gt;
      Sequencing of effectful computations can be neatly captured using monads and elegantly written using 
      &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation. In practice such monads often allow additional ways of composing computations, 
      which have to be written explicitly using combinators.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;"&gt;
      We identify joinads, an abstract notion of computation that is stronger than monads and captures
      many such ad-hoc extensions. In particular, joinads are monads with three additional operations: 
      one of type &lt;code&gt;m a -&amp;gt; m b -&amp;gt; m (a, b)&lt;/code&gt; captures various forms of &lt;em&gt;parallel composition&lt;/em&gt;, 
      one of type &lt;code&gt;m a -&amp;gt; m a -&amp;gt; m a&lt;/code&gt; that is inspired by &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; and one of type &lt;code&gt;m a -&amp;gt; m (m a)&lt;/code&gt; 
      that captures &lt;em&gt;aliasing&lt;/em&gt; of computations. Algebraically, the first two operations form a 
      near-semiring with commutative multiplication.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;"&gt;
      We introduce &lt;code&gt;docase&lt;/code&gt; notation that can be viewed as a monadic version of &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;. Joinad laws
      make it possible to prove various syntactic equivalences of programs written using &lt;code&gt;docase&lt;/code&gt; 
      that are analogous to equivalences about &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;. Examples of joinads that benefit from the notation
      include speculative parallelism, waiting for a combination of user interface events, but also 
      encoding of validation rules using the intersection of parsers.
      &lt;/p&gt;

This article is a re-publication of an article that I wrote some time ago for 
&lt;a href="http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/"&gt;The Monad.Reader&lt;/a&gt; magazine, which is an
online magazine about functional programming and Haskell. You can also
read the article in the original PDF format as part of the &lt;a href="http://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/issue18.pdf"&gt;Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monad comprehensions have an interesting history. They were the first syntactic extension for 
programming with monads. They were implemented in Haskell, but later replaced with plain list
comprehensions and monadic &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation. Now, monad comprehensions are back in Haskell,
more powerful than ever before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redesigned monad comprehensions generalize the syntax for working with lists. Quite interestingly, 
they also generalize syntax for zipping, grouping and ordering of lists. This article shows how to 
use some of the new expressive power when working with well-known monads. You'll learn what 
"parallel composition" means for parsers, a poor man's concurrency monad and an evaluation 
order monad.&lt;/p&gt;

User interface elements are accessible only on GUI threads and CPU-intensive computations should be done on a background thread. This article describes an extension of F# asynchronous workflows that guarantees correct use of threads using types.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/safe-gui-async/screen.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 0px 15px;" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-non-blocking-gui.aspx"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;,
  I discussed how to use F# asynchronous work­flows for creating reactive user-interfaces.
  One of the main concerns was to avoid blocking the GUI thread (to prevent the user-interface
  from freezing). The workflow shouldn't perform any CPU-intensive compu­tation when running
  on the GUI thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard F# library provides two ways to run a computation on a background thread from
  an asynchronous workflow. The &lt;code&gt;StartChild&lt;/code&gt; operation starts an operation 
  in the thread pool and returns a workflow that can be called using asynchronous (non-blocking)
  &lt;code&gt;let!&lt;/code&gt; construct. The &lt;code&gt;SwitchToThreadPool&lt;/code&gt; operation can be called
  using &lt;code&gt;do!&lt;/code&gt; and resumes the rest of the workflow on a background thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using the &lt;code&gt;SwitchToThreadPool&lt;/code&gt; operation, we also need to eventually use
  &lt;code&gt;SwitchToContext&lt;/code&gt; to transfer the execution back to the GUI thread (after 
  completing the CPU-intensive calculations). In this article, I describe a variation of 
  F# asynchronous workflows that keeps track of the running thread in the type of the 
  computation. As a result, calling a workflow that should be executed on a GUI thread 
  from a background thread is a compile-time error as opposed to failing at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

This article shows how to avoid blocking the user-interface when performing CPU-intensive processing.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/async-non-blocking-calls/screen.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 0px 15px;" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F# asynchronous workflows are best known as a way to write efficient I/O operations
  or as an underlying mechanism of F# agent-based programming (using the &lt;code&gt;MailboxProcessor&lt;/code&gt;
  type). However, they are also very useful for user-interface programming. I think this is 
  a very interesting and important area, so I already wrote and talked about this topic - 
  it is covered in &lt;a href="http://manning.com/petricek/"&gt;Chapter 16 of my book&lt;/a&gt; (there
  is a &lt;a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx"&gt;free excerpt&lt;/a&gt;)
  and I &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx"&gt;talked about it&lt;/a&gt; at F#unctional Londoners
  meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many applications combine user-interface programming (such as waiting for an event asynchronously)
  with some CPU-intensive tasks. This article looks at an example of such application and I'll explain 
  how to avoid blocking the user-interface when doing the CPU-intensive task. 
  The article starts with an example that is wrong and blocks the user-interface when doing data processing.
  Then I'll show you two options for fixing the problem. The three most important
  functions from the standard F# library that I'll discuss are &lt;code&gt;Async.StartChild&lt;/code&gt; and 
  &lt;code&gt;Async.SwitchTo­ThreadPool&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Async.SwitchToContext&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first article of a mini-series. In the next article, I'll demonstrate a simple
  wrapper for F# &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; that makes it more difficult to write &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; 
  programs. The wrapper keeps the desired thread (GUI or background) in the type of the 
  computations and code that would block the user interface will not type-check. But first,
  let's look at the example...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two weeks ago, I gave a talk at &lt;a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/"&gt;GOTO Conference&lt;/a&gt; in
  Copenhagen at a very interesting .NET session organized by &lt;a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk /"&gt;Mark Seemann&lt;/a&gt;.
  In my talk, I focused on the impedance mismatch between the data structures that are used
  in programming languages (such as classes in C# or records and discriminated unions in F#)
  and the data structures that we need to access (such as database, XML files and REST services).
   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, both of the sides have &lt;em&gt;some structure&lt;/em&gt; (otherwise, it wouldn't be possible
  to write any code against them!). Even an XML file that is returned by a REST service has some
  structure - although the only way to find out about the structure may be to call the service
  and then look at the result. In this article, I'll briefly summarize the ideas that I 
  presented in the talk. Here are links to the slides as well as the source code from the 
  talk: &lt;/p&gt;

This makes it possible to implement speculative parallelism using the monad and to build other high-level abstraction such as the unamb operator designed by Conal Elliott.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Haskell provides quite a few ways for writing parallel programs, but none of them is fully automatic.
  The programmer has to use some annotations or library to run computations in parallel &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt;. 
  The most recent paper (and library) for writing parallel programs follows the latter approach. You can find more
  information about the library in a paper by Simon Marlow et al. &lt;a type="external" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/parallel/monad-par.pdf"&gt;A
  monad for deterministic parallelism&lt;/a&gt; and it is also available on &lt;a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-par" type="external"&gt;Hackage&lt;/a&gt;.
  However, I'll explain all the important bits that I'll use in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The library provides an explicit way for writing parallel programs using a &lt;code&gt;Par&lt;/code&gt; monad. The library contains 
  constructs for spawning computations and sharing state using blocking variables. However, the whole programming model
  is fully deterministic. I believe that it is sometimes useful to lift the determinacy requirement.
  Some programs are deterministic, but the fact cannot be (easily) automatically verified. For example, say you have two functions
  &lt;code&gt;fib1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fib2&lt;/code&gt;. They both give the same result, but each of them is more efficient
  than the other one on certain inputs. To calculate a Fibonacci number, the program could &lt;em&gt;speculatively&lt;/em&gt; 
  try to evaluate both functions in parallel and return the result of the one that finishes first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this cannot be safely implemented using a fully deterministic library. In this article, I'll show some
  examples where speculative parallelism can be useful and I'll talk about an extension to the &lt;code&gt;Par&lt;/code&gt; monad
  that I implemented (available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Haskell.ParMonad"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;). The extension allows 
  programmers to write &lt;em&gt;speculative computations&lt;/em&gt;, provided that they manually verify that their code is 
  deterministic. &lt;/p&gt;

They simplify conrurrent programming with tasks, reactive programming with events, but can be also used for other types of computations. This article introduces the extension, which is now available, based on the open-source source-drop of F#.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'll write about an experimental extension for F# that I call 
  &lt;em&gt;joinads&lt;/em&gt;. If you're following my blog, you may have seen an 
  &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx"&gt;academic paper&lt;/a&gt; that
  I wrote about it some time ago. Anyway, the motivation for the extension
  is that there are many useful programming models for reactive, concurrent and parallel programming 
  that would deserve some syntactic support in the programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when programming with &lt;em&gt;futures&lt;/em&gt; (the &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type), 
  you may want to implement logical "or" operator for tasks that returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;
  immediately when the first task completes returning &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. When programming with 
  &lt;em&gt;events&lt;/em&gt; (the &lt;code&gt;IObservable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type),
  we'd like to wait for the event that happens first. Finally, when programming using &lt;em&gt;agents&lt;/em&gt;,
  we sometimes need to wait only for certain types of messages. All of these problems can
  be solved, but require the use of (sometimes fairly complicated) functions. Joinads make
  it possible to solve them directly using the &lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; syntax. For example, here
  is the "or" operator for tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="fssnip"&gt;
&lt;span class="l"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs1', 1)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs1', 1)" class="i"&gt;future&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;span class="l"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;match!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs2', 2)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs2', 2)" class="i"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs2', 3)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs2', 3)" class="i"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l"&gt;3: &lt;/span&gt;  | &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;, _ &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l"&gt;4: &lt;/span&gt;  | _, &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l"&gt;5: &lt;/span&gt;  | &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs3', 4)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs3', 4)" class="i"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs4', 5)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs4', 5)" class="i"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs3', 6)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs3', 6)" class="i"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs4', 7)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs4', 7)" class="i"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll write more about this example (and the implementation) in a later article. This article
  focuses on the compiler extension itself. I created a first implementation of the idea above during
  my &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/internship-match-bang.aspx"&gt;internship with Don Syme at MSR Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;,
  but then changed it quite a bit when writing the academic paper mentioned above. However, I never released
  the source code.
&lt;/p&gt;

  quite easy to modify the F# compiler and make the modifications available, so I decided I should 
  finally release my F# extensions. I also recently &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/formlets-in-linq.aspx"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; encoding &lt;em&gt;idioms&lt;/em&gt; (also called
  &lt;em&gt;applicative functors&lt;/em&gt;) in C#. I was wondering how to do that in F# and so I also created a simple
  extension computations based on this abstraction. The support for &lt;em&gt;idioms&lt;/em&gt; is just an experiment, but it could 
  be useful, for example, for programming with formlets. You'll find more about it at the end of the

In this article, we look how to write formlets in C#. Although formlets are not monads, we can still use elegant LINQ syntax. Interestingly, using the join clause...</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/formlets-in-linq/screen.png" style="margin:15px;float:right;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LINQ query syntax can be used for various things. Aside from writing queries, you can 
  also use it to encode any &lt;em&gt;monads&lt;/em&gt;. This has become a fashionable topic, so you can learn
  more about it at many .NET conferences (for example &lt;a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=434"&gt;GOTO 2011&lt;/a&gt;).
  There are also many blog posts on this topic and I explained it in details in Chapter 12 of &lt;a href="http://manning.com/petricek"&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt;, which
  is available as a &lt;a href="http://manning.com/petricek/SampleChapter12.pdf"&gt;free sample chapter&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you can also use LINQ syntax for writing different types of computations. In a 
  &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx"&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I introduced &lt;em&gt;idioms&lt;/em&gt;
  (also called &lt;em&gt;applicative functors&lt;/em&gt;) and I demonstrated how to use the &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; syntax in LINQ
  to write computations based on idioms. We looked at a slightly boring, but simple example - zipping of lists - and
  we also implemented matrix transposition.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we look at a more exciting example. I explain &lt;em&gt;formlets&lt;/em&gt;, which is an &lt;em&gt;idiom&lt;/em&gt;
  for building web forms. Formlets give us an elegant functional way to create reusable components that encapsulate
  both visual aspect (HTML) and behavior (processing of requests). You can think of them as functional ASP.NET controls.
  Formlets come from the &lt;a href="http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/links/formlets/"&gt;Links project&lt;/a&gt; and they are now used in commercial products like
  &lt;a href="http://www.websharper.com/tutorials/GettingStartedWithFormlets.aspx"&gt;WebSharper&lt;/a&gt;. In this article, you'll see that we can (mis)use LINQ to get a nicer syntax
  for writing code using formlets. My C# implementation of formlets is based on a nice &lt;a href="http://bugsquash.blogspot.com/2011/01/simple-implementation-of-formlets-in-f.html"&gt;F# formlets by Mauricio
  Scheffer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This article demonstrates that you can use LINQ to program using &lt;em&gt;idioms&lt;/em&gt;, which are in some ways more useful than monads.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to LINQ and Erik Meier, monads have become a fashionable topic in the C# developer community.
  Indeed, no serious developer conference on .NET can get away without having a talk on monads. The attractive
  thing about LINQ and monads is that the &lt;code&gt;SelectMany&lt;/code&gt; operator roughly corresponds to the &lt;em&gt;bind&lt;/em&gt;
  function that defines a monad. In practice, LINQ is used for working with collections of data (&lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;),
  but you can also define &lt;em&gt;bind&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. &lt;code&gt;SelectMany&lt;/code&gt;) for some other data types and use the LINQ syntax
  for working with other types. You won't be really using the full LINQ syntax. You'll probably use just nested
  &lt;code&gt;from&lt;/code&gt; clauses (for &lt;em&gt;binding&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; at the end to return the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, monads are not the only notion of computation that we can work with. More interestingly, they are also 
  not the only notion of computation that you can encode using LINQ! In this article, I'll briefly introduce 
  &lt;em&gt;idioms&lt;/em&gt; (also called &lt;em&gt;applicative functors&lt;/em&gt;), which is another useful abstract type of computations.
  Idioms can be used for a few things that cannot be done using monads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A provocative summary of this article is: &lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;"Everyone who tells you that LINQ is a monad is wrong!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is
that LINQ syntax can be used for encoding &lt;em&gt;queries&lt;/em&gt; (obviously), &lt;em&gt;monads&lt;/em&gt; (as you were told), but also for &lt;em&gt;idioms&lt;/em&gt; as you'll learn today (and quite possibly for other types of computations). In this article, we look at a basic example, but I'll describe a more complex real-world scenario in the next blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that I have been doing a lot more talking than writing in the last two months.
  I'm hoping to change this direction and I have two articles almost ready, so stay tuned!
  I was also posting all my interesting F# snippets to &lt;a href="http://fssnip.net/authors/Tomas+Petricek"&gt;fssnip.net&lt;/a&gt;,
  which has grown quite a bit since I announced it in the last blog post. Thanks to everybody
  who submitted their snippets already and I'm looking forward to more! By the way, you can
  now run snippets using &lt;a href="http://tryfs.net/"&gt;tryfs.net&lt;/a&gt; by clicking at 
  "Load in TryF#" button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the queue with talk materials that I wanted to post on my blog 
  has grown to 3. I talked about F# in MonoDevelop in the &lt;a href="http://weblog.savanne.be/376-fosdem-2011-mono-room-slides"&gt;Mono room at FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt; in February, 
  then I did an online talk for the &lt;a href="http://www.communityforfsharp.net/"&gt;Community for F# &lt;/a&gt;.
  Finally, this week, I did a tutorial on F# with &lt;a href="http://www.trelford.com/blog/"&gt;Phil Trelford&lt;/a&gt;
  at QCon in London (to fill in for Michael Stal due to unexpected health reasons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I move on to writing about my recent experiments with LINQ, you can find materials from
  all of the recent talks below... &lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcing F# snippets web site</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/fssnip-website.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2010 02:19:34 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">When writing F# code, I often write some nice code snippet or helper function that I'd like to share with the F# community.

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing F# programs, I often write some nice code snippet or some useful helper
  function that I'd like to share with the F# community. Unfortunately, my blog posts are
  usually longer and more elaborate, so I never get to blogging about it. Now that I have a 
  twitter (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek"&gt;follow me if you don't already&lt;/a&gt;)
  I thought I could just post the snippet somewhere, but there was no 
  good web site for posting F# snippets - until now! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you can't wait any further, then go directly to the new F# snippets web site at
  	&lt;a href="http://fssnip.net"&gt;fssnip.net&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web site uses my earlier project &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fswebsnippets-intro.aspx"&gt;F# Web Snippets&lt;/a&gt; to format F# source
  code. It highlights colors and adds JavaScript tooltips using services provided by the
  F# compiler, which means that you'll get almost the same experience as when reading code
  in Visual Studio. I also wanted to make the page a repository of browsable snippets, so you can use
  it in two ways...&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>F# in Education &amp;amp; Concurrency with Agents</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/education-and-agents-talks.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2010 19:18:13 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">This article contains materials for two talks that I had in November. First, I presented the F# plugin for MonoDevelop at the F# in Education workshop in Boston (using 3D functional library) and then I talked about agent-based concurrency (with Twitter and image processing examples) in London.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/education-and-agents-talk/castle.jpg" class="rdecor" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November was quite a busy month for me. First, I traveled to Cambridge (the "new one" in
  Massachusetts :-)) to present my work on the F# plugin for MonoDevelop at the F# in Education workshop.
  Shortly after getting back to London, I started working on a presentation about Concurrent Programming
  with Agents at the F#unctional Londoners meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that both of the events are over, I'd like to write a short summary and also finally
  publish my slides and demos. In addition, both of the events were recorded (thanks to External 
  Research group at MSR and SkillsMatter), so if you missed them, you can watch the recording...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the events were really great and I had a chance to meet quite a few interesting people. 
  One of the things that make F# great is the community around it. I think that one unique aspect of the
  F# community is its diversity. The same language is appealing to high school teachers, academics and 
  researchers as well as software developers and technical directors from the industry. This combination
  is really valuable for both sides. It helps to transfer ideas from research to practice it 
  gives researchers clear picture of problems in the industry that deserve their attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time, I brought a copy of my &lt;a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek" type="external"&gt;Real-World Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt; as 
  a giveaway and I think I still have a few copies lying around...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Talk teaser: F# agents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F# agents (the &lt;code&gt;MailboxProcessor&lt;/code&gt; type) are an implementation of message passing concurrency.
  This is a very attractive alternative to shared memory or even standard task-based or data-parallel
  concurrency models. It makes it easy to write reactive applications that receive inputs from
  various sources in parallel (e.g. user interface, network, background tasks etc.) Agents 
  communicate by sending (immutable) messages to each other, which makes the application
  easy to understand. If you design the application correctly (and structure it using enough agents)
  it can be also very scalable. Among other things, I'll show the following examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agent-based chat&lt;/strong&gt; - A simple example to introduce agents will be
    a chat room that uses agent to store the state of a chat. You'll see that an asynchronous
    and concurrent application can be written quite easily with F#. You'll also see how to 
    expose this service using a few lines of beautiful F# code inspired by &lt;code&gt;Node.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reusable agents, buffering and blocking&lt;/strong&gt; - We'll also look at a few agents that 
    are not directly bound to any application and you can use them to implement common 
    communication patterns. If you have a few agents like this, you can easily put together
    a sophisticated application just by composing existing agents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We compare the compilation in C# (based on state machines) and the compilation in F# (based on combinators) and we look at advantages and disadvantages of both of the approaches.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I started writing a series about the differences between the asynchronous model in F# 
  (in Visual Studio 2010) and the asynchronous language extensions for C# proposed at PDC 2010.
  In the &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx"&gt;first article&lt;/a&gt;, I showed
  how both of the language features look and I highlighted a couple of differences. In the
  &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx"&gt;second article&lt;/a&gt;, I discussed
  the support for cancellation (available only in F#) and how the two models differ 
  &lt;em&gt;semantically&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. what are differences in the behaviour). However, I didn't talk about more
  techincal differences and, in particular, how is the asynchronous code compiled. We'll look 
  at this topic today...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the C# asynchronous programming model is very similar to F# asynchronous workflows,
  the compilation looks quite different. The C# compiler uses a similar technique as when compiling
  iterators and creates a state machine, while the F# compiler uses an approach based on higher order
  functions (combinators) that's shared with (most) other computation expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't discuss the syntax of F# asynchronous workflows or the C# asynchronous extensions in 
  this article, so if you're new to one of these, here are links to other articles in this 
  series: &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Asynchronous C# and F# (IV.): Calling F# libraries from C# &lt;em&gt;(not yet available)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Let's start by looking at the mechanism used in the C# compiler. If you already know how
  iterators work in C# 2.0, then you'll find it quite easy to understand. If you're not familiar
  with iterators, then don't worry - I'll make the explanation self-contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I talked with Miguel de Icaza and Michael Hutchinson at the &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/fsharpined/"&gt;F# in Education
  workshop&lt;/a&gt; some time ago, someone mentioned that it would be nice to have a clone
  of the official F# code drop that could accept patches from the community. 
  I also talked with Michael about &lt;a href="http://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and I 
  think I finally understood why everybody uses it today. I said to myself that
  I'll need to take a look at it when I'll have a bit of time...
  After coming back from the workshop, I was quite busy getting the F# plugin for
  MonoDevelop out, but after I wrote about it, I finally found some time to look
  at &lt;a href="http://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the way Mono team uses GitHub. They have a single "mono" organization
  that is owned by several people from the Mono community and all important projects
  that are parts of Mono have their repository as part of the "mono" organization. 
  Thanks to GitHub, everyone can easily clone the repository, do some changes and submit
  a "pull request" to the main repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that the F# community could follow the same model, so I started the

It was a great event
  with many interesting people around. I believe that the workshop was very exciting for everyone who is
  interested in F#, but uses Mac or Linux. The F# team recently made some effort to improve the
  F# support on Mono (meaning mainly Mac and Linux). The recent &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/10/november-2010-f-2-0-free-tools-update.aspx" type="external"&gt;November 2010 CTP update&lt;/a&gt;
  contains several bugfixes that make it possible to use F# on Mono 2.8. Another great thing 
  that happened at the workshop is the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx" type="external"&gt;open source release of F#&lt;/a&gt;
  (see also &lt;a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Nov-11.html" type="external"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Miguel with a post-check-in photo).
  At the workshop, I also announced my contribution to the cross-platform F# story, a project that 
  I've been working on recently - &lt;strong&gt;the F# language binding
  for MonoDevelop.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center;"&gt;
  &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-in-monodevelop/screen.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-in-monodevelop/screen-sm.png" style="border:0px;margin-bottom:5px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-in-monodevelop/screen.png"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Click here for a larger screenshot&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promised to make it available as soon as possible after the workshop. As usually, things take
  longer, than one would like, but I'm finally ready to announce the initial (beta) version of the 
  plugin. The screenshot on the right shows some of the features of the F# language binding. As you
  can see, there is an F# Interactive tool window, syntax highlighting as well as IntelliSense 
  auto-completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in trying it out, here are links to the repository (you can use
  it to install the language binding from the MonoDevelop Add-ins manager) and source
  code. The F# plugin needs to be able to locate F# installation and it also requires 
  more F# assemblies to be installed in the GAC, so you may as well want to read the instructions
  before trying it :-).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="spaces"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://functional-variations.net/monodevelop/" type="external"&gt;Project homepage&lt;/a&gt; at the Functional Variations 
    web site has more information about the project as well as detailed installation instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I also created a web page that contains information about &lt;a href="http://functional-variations.net/crossplatform/" type="external"&gt;installing
    F# on Mac and Linux&lt;/a&gt; which explains how to install F#, such that the MonoDevelop plugin can 
    find it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The source code is available in the &lt;a href="http://fsxplat.codeplex.com/" type="external"&gt;F# cross-platform packages and samples&lt;/a&gt; project at CodePlex
    (under the Apache 2.0 license). You can find it in the &lt;code&gt;monodevelop&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Online repositiory with a MonoDevelop package is available at: &lt;a href="http://functional-variations.net/addin"&gt;http://functional-variations.net/addin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;(If you're a hacker, the easiest way to get it working is to add &lt;code&gt;FSharp.Compiler*&lt;/code&gt; to GAC and set &lt;code&gt;FSHARP_COMPILER_BIN&lt;/code&gt; environment
    variable to F# installation location)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see some interesting uses of the F# MonoDevelop plugin, you can also watch 
  &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/fsharpined/videos.aspx" type="external"&gt;my 
  talk at the F# in Education event&lt;/a&gt;. In one demo, I used F# on Mac to play with a simple, composable
  functional 3D library. In another example I demonstrated how to asynchronously process stock 
  prices on Linux. The last demo, showing my &lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; extension didn't work all that well, because
  I had too many virtual machines running, but I'll blog about &lt;code&gt;match!&lt;/code&gt; again sooner or later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the F# plugin for MonoDevelop itself, I'd also like to mention two web sites that
  I've been working on and some interesting cross-platform F# screencasts...&lt;/p&gt;

  The extension looks very similar to F# asynchronous workflows (which are already available in Visual Studio 2010). 
  Despite the large similarity, there are a couple of differences between the two programming models. I already mentioned 
  some of them briefly in &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx"&gt;the first article of this series&lt;/a&gt;.
  In this article, we'll look at some of the technical differences between the two models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable non-technical difference is that F# asynchronous workflows are already available in a 
  supported version of Visual Studio and can be used on a large number of .NET runtimes (including, for example,
  Windows Phone and Silverlight). However, there are surprisingly many technical differences as well.
  In this article, I'll talk about the support for cancellation, which is available in F# and is not
  (currently) available in the C# preview. We'll also look at the difference between model where tasks
  are created as running and the delayed model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is the second part of a short series about the asynchronous programming support
  in C# and F#. The previous article shows a simple example in both of the languages and the next
  articles explain how does the feature work (and how you can customize its behavior) as well as 
  how to call F# libraries from C#:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start by looking at, perhaps, the most important technical difference - the 
  built-in support for cancellation available in F# asynchronous workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the exciting new technologies that was announced at &lt;a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/"&gt;PDC 2010&lt;/a&gt;
  is the support for &lt;em&gt;asynchronous programming&lt;/em&gt; in C#. So what exactly is &lt;em&gt;asynchronous programming&lt;/em&gt;?
  Many applications today need to connect to some service or external data source including, for example, 
  Web Services and REST APIs. This calls may take a long time to run, but we want to run them without
  blocking the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, you can run the operation on a background thread or using a &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt;, but
  coordinating multiple such operations is difficult. What if you for example need to wait until
  any (or all) of downloads complete and run some more code then? This is not only difficult, but
  it also scales badly, because blocking .NET threads is a bad practice (Threads are expensive and when
  they're just waiting for other operation to complete, we're wasting valuable resources).
  This problem has been the main motivation for including &lt;em&gt;asynchronous workflows&lt;/em&gt; in F#
  about 3 years ago. In F#, this also enabled various interesting programming styles - for example
  &lt;a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx" type="external"&gt;creating 
  GUI using asynchronous workflows&lt;/a&gt; (also discussed in Chapter 16 of &lt;a href="http://manning.com/petricek"&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; and in 
  in &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx"&gt;my recent talk&lt;/a&gt;). The C# asynchronous 
  programming support and the &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keyword is largely inspired by
  F# &lt;em&gt;asynchronous workflows&lt;/em&gt; (I was quite surprised that F# wasn't more visibly 
  mentioned in the PDC talk).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article series, I'll demonstrate both F# and C# asynchronous programming model,
  I'll look at features that are missing in one or the other as well as a few subtle differences
  (that may be unexpected) and finally, I'll write about writing (asynchronous) F# libraries 
  that are easy to use from C#. The plan for the series is following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a brief overview of asynchronous programming features in C# and F#...&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>F# Parallel Extras (III.): Financial dashboard with cancellation</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-adash-cancellation.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2010 11:13:08 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">In this article, we revisit an F# implementation of a financial dashboard example from Parallel Programming with .NET. The article explains and demonstrates how to use the built-in support for cancellation in F# asynchronous workflows.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In this article we'll look at several improvements that can be done to the Financial dashboard example
  (originally from the &lt;a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external"&gt;Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET&lt;/a&gt; book).
  When I was translating samples in the book from C# to F#, the sample struck me, because it looks like
  a perfect fit for F# asynchronous workflows (instead of the &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type used in the
  C# version). I already talked about an &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-adash.aspx"&gt;alternative 
  implementation&lt;/a&gt; based on asynchronous workflows. However that version was still following some of the
  programming patterns, from the original C# version, which are not idiomatic in F#. In this article, I'll talk
  about a few other improvements that we can make to the sample...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original version of the sample (in both C# and F#), we explicitly checked whether a cancellation
  token has been cancelled in every single operation. This was needed in C#, because tasks do not support
  cancellation automatically. However, F# asynchronous workflows make cancellation easier. They automatically
  check if the computation should be cancelled at the beginning and the end of every asynchronous call. Our
  first change will be to use this feature. Also, the original version propagates a &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; value
  when the computation is cancelling. In F# we don't need that and we'll only change the type of the overall
  result to &lt;code&gt;option&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so that we can notify the user interface (but we don't need to 
  propagate cancellation explicitly). Finally, the original version contained sequential implementation, but
  didn't provide any way of actually running it, so we'll do a bit of refactoring to make that sample 
  actually useable.&lt;/p&gt;

This can be used, for example, when implementing the pipeline pattern as demonstrated in the &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-image-pipeline.html"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-image-pipeline.aspx"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, we 
  briefly introduced the &lt;code&gt;BlockingQueueAgent&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type and we used it to implement the
  pipeline pattern (from Chapter 7 of &lt;a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external"&gt;Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET&lt;/a&gt;)
  using asynchronous workflows. The type was used to represent intermediate buffers with a limited size.
  In this article we'll take a look at the implementation of the type. The type implements a very useful
  pattern in agent-based parallel programming, so you can use it in your work, but it could be also 
  interesting as a demonstration of the F# &lt;code&gt;Agent&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type (an recommended alias 
  for the &lt;code&gt;MailboxProcessor&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;BlockingQueueAgent&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type is similar to &lt;code&gt;BlockingCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
  from .NET 4.0. It has methods for adding and removing elements that block when the operation cannot be
  done (e.g. adding when the queue is full or removing when the queue is empty). The most important 
  difference is that it can be used &lt;em&gt;asynchronously&lt;/em&gt;. This means that when we call its operations
  form F# asynchronous workflow (using &lt;code&gt;let!&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;do!&lt;/code&gt;), the operation will block
  the calling workflow, but it will not block any physical thread. We start by looking at the overall
  structure of the agent and then look at the body of the agent which implements its behavior (using
  a state machine)...&lt;/p&gt;

  I wrote about parallel programming samples that accompany the 
  &lt;a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external"&gt;Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET&lt;/a&gt;
  book by patterns &amp;amp; practices group at Microsoft. The F# translation of the samples that I
  wrote about mostly followed the style used in the book, so it used patterns that 
  are typical for C#. However, some of the samples can be written in F# in a more interesting way...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we'll take a look at agent-based implementation of the Image pipeline 
  example (from chapter 7). A &lt;em&gt;pipeline&lt;/em&gt; is a useful pattern if you need to process large
  number of inputs in parallel and the processing consists of multiple phases or steps. In the
  original implementation, the pipeline was implemented using &lt;code&gt;BlockingCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
  and &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; types from .NET 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'll show a 
  version that uses F# agents and asynchronous workflows. We'll use a &lt;code&gt;BlockingQueueAgent&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
  type, which is &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-blockingagent.aspx"&gt;discussed in another 
  article&lt;/a&gt;. It represents a queue with limited capacity that asynchronously blocks the process that is adding 
  values if there is no space in the buffer and blocks the process that reads values when there are no 
  values. This type can be elegantly used to implement the pipeline pattern. In this article, we'll 
  demonstrate it by writing a four-phase pipeline that processes images. As you'll see, 
  the agent-based version of the code is very much easier to write and has similar performance as 
  the original version.&lt;/p&gt;

  a paper on the F# Asynchrounous Programming Model&lt;/a&gt; that I helped to write. Without any doubt,
  the asynchronous programming features of F# are one of the reason for its success and also 
  influence other teams in Microsoft. However, I'm very glad that there is now also an academic
  paper that makes this idea accessible to the academic community. I believe that the ideas could
  evolve in interesting ways when used in other programming languages and also, it is now easier to 
  create research projects that build on top of the F# model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don already mentioned that we have another paper accepted at PADL. The paper describes work 
  that started during my internship at Microsoft Research in 2009. It presents a simple 
  language extension for &lt;em&gt;computation expressions&lt;/em&gt; that makes them even more useful 
  in some reactive, concurrent and parallel programming models. Note that this is only a 
  research project and there are currently no plans to support the extension in the F# language
  (although, if there will, eventually, be an open-source F# release, then you'll hear about the 
  extension again...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the abstract of the paper (accepted at &lt;a href="http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/PADL-2011/"&gt;PADL 2011&lt;/a&gt;) and a PDF download link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;"&gt;Joinads: A retargetable control-flow construct for reactive, parallel and concurrent programming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;"&gt;
  Modern challenges led to a design of a wide range of programming models for reactive, parallel 
  and concurrent programming, but these are often difficult to encode in general purpose languages. 
  We present an abstract type of computations called joinads together with a syntactic language 
  extension that aims to make it easier to use joinads in modern functional languages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;"&gt;
  Our extension generalizes pattern matching to work on abstract computations. It keeps a familiar 
  syntax and semantics of pattern matching making it easy to reason about code, even in a 
  non-standard programming model. We demonstrate our extension using three important programming 
  models – a reactive model based on events; a concurrent model based on join calculus and a 
  parallel model using futures. All three models are implemented as libraries that benefit from 
  our syntactic extension. This makes them easier to use and also opens space for exploring new 
  useful programming models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper can still be revised before the final publication, so any comments and suggestions
  for improvement are largely welcome. You can contact me either via comments (below) or using 
  email at &lt;a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net"&gt;tomas@tomasp.net&lt;/a&gt;. I would be also quite interested
  to hear from anybody who would like to implement similar feature in other programming languages
  (for example Haskell or Scala).&lt;/p&gt;

This article introduces a tool that makes it possible to bring the same user experience to your F# code snippets published on the Web.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/fswebsnippets/logo-sm.png" style="float:right;margin:10px 5px 10px 10px" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languages with type-inference make it possible to write shorter code, because a smart
  compiler infers the types automatically. Even though we don't write the types, they are
  still there and are used to check whether our code doesn't contain (certain type of) bugs.
  However, types are not only useful for safety, but also when understanding code. When you 
  see a function together with its type (especially higher-order functions) you can understand
  code much more easily than when you just see its name.
  When writing F# code, you can see all the types thanks to great integration for Visual Studio.
  However, what if you post a code sample to a web site or a blog? Many F# code snippets (including
  some on this blog) are just difficult to read without types. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I was talking with James Margetson (from the F# team) about the possible uses
  of some functionality provided by the F# compiler and he suggested that we could use them
  to solve the problem I described in the introduction. Wouldn't it be nice if you could place a 
  mouse cursor over an identifier in an F# blog post and see the same type information as the 
  one that would appear in Visual Studio? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of what I'm talking about: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="fssnip"&gt;

  on .NET 4.0. The C# version of the sample is in details discussed in the guide, but the F# translation
  contains several additional interesting aspects that I'll introduce in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample simulates a financial modelling application that performs processing of market
  data in several steps that can be partly executed in parallel. In this article we'll compare two
  implementations. The first one (similar to the C# version) uses the &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;'T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type 
  from .NET 4.0 and chains steps using the &lt;code&gt;ContinueWith&lt;/code&gt; method. The second version is 
  F# specific and it implements step as a sequential computation wrapped in asynchronous 
  workflows. Partial results are reported to the user interface using events.&lt;/p&gt;

  from Chapter 4 of &lt;a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external"&gt;Parallel 
  Programming with Microsoft .NET&lt;/a&gt;, which is a guide that introduces common parallel programming patterns
  on .NET 4.0. The C# version of the sample is in details discussed in the guide. In this article,
  we'll look at the F# translation and in particular at several functions from the &lt;code&gt;PSeq&lt;/code&gt;
  module. Some of the functionality is currently available only in the "PSeq.fs" distributed with the
  samples, but will eventually appear in F# PowerPack as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aggregation of data in parallel is an interesting problem. As we've seen in the previous article, 
  PLINQ and tasks make it easy to parallelize independent blocks of code that don't share any state.
  Unfortunatelly, not all programs are like that. In particular, we often need to aggregate all
  elements of a sequence - when writing sequential code in F#, you would use the &lt;code&gt;Seq.fold&lt;/code&gt;
  function. In this article, we'll look at functions that implement fold parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

  example (using closures) where C# version doesn't behave as expected, but a literal translation in F# corrects the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external"&gt;Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET&lt;/a&gt; is a 
  guide written by the patterns &amp;amp; practices group at Microsoft. It introduces .NET programmers to
  patterns for including parallelism in their applications (using support for parallel programming in
  .NET 4.0). It introduces techniques such as parallel loops, parallel tasks, data aggregation and so on.
  The book includes numerous samples in C# and Visual Basic that can be easily copied and adapted 
  to match your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a contracting work for the F# team, I developed an F# version of the samples, which is 
  now available on the &lt;a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external"&gt;book web site&lt;/a&gt;.
  You can get it by downloading &lt;a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/releases/view/50473"&gt;F# code samples&lt;/a&gt; (ZIP) from the 1.0 release, or you can download the &lt;a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets" type="external"&gt;latest version of the source code&lt;/a&gt; directly. The F# version of the
  code is mostly a direct translation of the C# versions, but there are a few interesting places that
  are worth discussing. In particular, some of the samples use the &lt;code&gt;PSeq&lt;/code&gt; module from F#
  PowerPack and I also added a version of one example that uses F# asynchronous workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article series, I'll look at several interesting examples from the F# version of the source code.
  We'll look how to use PLINQ and Tasks (which are available in .NET 4.0) from F# (Part II.) including some advanced topics such 
  as the Map-Reduce algorithm (Part III.). We'll also look at a larger example built using tasks and an alternative 
  implementation using asynchronous workflows (Part IV.) Here are links to the individual articles:&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is useful for understading what events are garbage and can be garbage collected.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Mathematical duality [&lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/event-object-duality.aspx&amp;#xD;&amp;#xA;#duallinks"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;] 
  is a very useful and elegant concept that gives us a nice way of speaking
  about objects or structures that behave in some way exactly conversely. There
  is no clear definition of what &lt;em&gt;duality&lt;/em&gt; is. However, the idea is that when we
  have two structures that behave conversely and we know that something is true
  about the first one, then we get the opposite statement about the other structure
  "for free" (if you know how to translate from one structure to the other).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'll talk about an interesting example of duality that (to my best
  knowledge) wasn't described by anyone before. The two dual structures are 
  &lt;strong&gt;references between objects&lt;/strong&gt; in a normal program and &lt;strong&gt;references
  between events&lt;/strong&gt; in a reactive application. The statement that is going to 
  become obvious thanks to the duality principle is describing which of the objects (or
  events) are garbage and can be safely collected by garbage collector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic is in much more details 
  discussed in a paper [&lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/event-object-duality.aspx&amp;#xD;&amp;#xA;#duallinks"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;] I wrote with &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/dsyme/"&gt;Don Syme&lt;/a&gt; 
  and that I presented at the ISMM Workshop (see also &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/pldi-2010-trip.aspx"&gt;my
  trip report from PLDI&lt;/a&gt;). In this article, I'll try to give an accessible
  description of the most interesting idea from the paper...&lt;/p&gt;

We'll see how to use dynamic invoke operator to make the usual ADO.NET code remarkably elegant and simple...</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;When reading data from a SQL database in F#, you have a couple of options.
  You can use F# implementation of LINQ, which allows you to write queries directly
  in the F# language or you can use standard ADO.NET classes such as &lt;code&gt;SqlCommand&lt;/code&gt;.
  The second option is often good enough - when you just need to call a simple 
  query, you probably don't want to setup the whole LINQ infrastructure (generate
  classes, reference F# PowerPack, etc.) Unfortunately, ADO.NET classes are a bit
  ugly to use. When calling an SQL stored procedure, you need to specify the name
  of the procedure as a string, you need to add parameters one-by-one by creating
  instances of &lt;code&gt;SqlParameter&lt;/code&gt;, you need to dynamically cast results from 
  the &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; type and so on...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we'll look how to use the &lt;em&gt;dynamic operator&lt;/em&gt; to make the
  experience of using ADO.NET from F# dramatically better. Dynamic operator (there are
  actually two of them) are a simple way of supporting dynamic invoke in F#. We can use
  it to write code that looks almost like an ordinary method call or property access,
  but is resolved dynamically at runtime (using the name of the method or property).
  The following example shows what we'll be able to write at the end 
  of this article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre lang="fsharp"&gt;
// Call 'GetProducts' procedure with 'CategoryID' set to 1
use conn = new DynamicSqlConnection(connectionString)
use cmd = conn?GetProducts
cmd?CategoryID &amp;lt;- 1
conn.Open()

// Read all products and print their names
use reader = cmd.ExecuteReader()
while reader.Read() do
  printfn "Product: %s" reader?ProductName
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever tried to call a SQL stored procedure directly using the 
  &lt;code&gt;SqlCommand&lt;/code&gt;, then you can surely appreciate the elegance of this code
  snippet. Let's now take a look at a larger example and some of the neat 
  tricks that make this possible...&lt;/p&gt;

  Languages Design and Implementation (PLDI 2010)&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto. I attended the conference, because
  I presented a paper that I wrote with Don Syme as a result of my internship at Microsoft Research, but
  I'll write more about that shortly (and thanks to MSR for partly supporting my attendance at the conference!)&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;As far as I understand it, the 
  focus of the conference is more on &lt;em&gt;implementation&lt;/em&gt;. Many people believe that the current 
  programming languages are good enough and we need to make sure that they run well (e.g. compilers 
  optimize code to run better on multi-core) and that we need better tools for working with them 
  (e.g. automatic verification of the code we write), so these areas were the main focus of the
  conference. However, there were some very interesting talks on the &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt; of programming 
  languages, which is an area that I personally find more interesting...

  F# talk at the F#unctional Londoners user group. The theme of my talk was &lt;em&gt;reactive programming&lt;/em&gt;, which 
  was also a topic of my &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/reactive-thesis.aspx"&gt;Master's thesis&lt;/a&gt; (defended
  earlier in June), so I really enjoyed talking about it. In the talk, I discussed the two approaches that you can 
  use for developing reactive applications in F# (using examples in Silverlight):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/tomas-petricek-reactive-programming-in-fsharp"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/reactive-talk-london/pic.jpg" style="margin:10px; float:right; border-style:none;" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Declarative&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;data-flow&lt;/em&gt; oriented) allows you to describe "what" should be 
    done with data that your component receives from various events (such as mouse position etc.) This can 
    be written using F# event combinators such as &lt;code&gt;Event.map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Event.scan&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;control-flow&lt;/em&gt; oriented) - in this style, we describe various
    states of the component (e.g. semaphore with green, orange and red) and describe transitions between the
    states. This can be written using F# &lt;em&gt;asynchronous workflows&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;AwaitObservable&lt;/code&gt;
    primitive (which you can get as part of the source code).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reactive Programming with F#&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure you're already convinced to come. Nevertheless, you may still want to know 
  what I'm going to talk about. There are many areas where F# offers clear benefits such as
  parallel &amp;amp; concurrent programming. I believe that &lt;strong&gt;reactive programming&lt;/strong&gt;
  is another great area for F#. In reactive programming, we face quite different problems than
  in other programming styles. We (as the authors of the application) can no longer specify what
  the application should do. Instead, the application needs to be able to handle many possible
  combinations of events. This aspect of programming is sometimes called &lt;em&gt;inversion of control&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive programming is important for programming user interfaces, especially today when
  user interfaces are becoming more interactive and more "fancy". To demonstrate this, I'm working on some nice &lt;strong&gt;Silverlight&lt;/strong&gt; demos for the talk! However, it is also needed
  to handle other kinds of events such as completion of background task or message from 
  other application. We'll look at the two essential techniques that F# provides for reactive
  programming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Declarative event combinators&lt;/strong&gt; - one way of writing reactive applications
    is to specify the whole event processing declaratively by saying "what" should be done with 
    occurrences of events. This is particularly useful when we need to encode simpler
    logic with a clear &lt;em&gt;data-flow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative using workflows&lt;/strong&gt; - for more complicated interactions, we can
    use &lt;em&gt;asynchronous workflows&lt;/em&gt;. This makes the code more explicit, but we get full 
    control over the &lt;em&gt;control-flow&lt;/em&gt; of the application. Even though this approach is 
    more "imperative" it can be used for writing nicely composable functional code as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to seeing you at the talk next week!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ASP.NET and F# (I.) - Creating MVC web applications in F#</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-mvc-web.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 May 2010 20:43:52 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">This article shows how to use F# for developing ASP.NET web applications using the MVC framework. It also shows how to access data using LINQ in F# and how to simplify web programming using F# meta-programming, modules and records.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I wrote a couple of examples of &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/aspnet-in-fsharp.aspx"&gt;
  developing web applications in F# using ASP.NET&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the F# language and runtime has changed
  a little bit and there are also new technologies available in ASP.NET, so I thought I'd write a more
  up-to-date article on this topic. In this article, I'll present a simple "demo" F# web application that
  you can use as a starting point when creating your own projects (you'll also find a convenient Visual
  Studio 2010 template below). The article shows the following interesting things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASP.NET MVC&lt;/strong&gt; - We're going to use ASP.NET MVC Framework to create the web
    application. As the article name suggests, most of the actual program code including models and
    controllers will be implemented in F#.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F# LINQ to SQL&lt;/strong&gt; - The application uses a sample Northwind database and we'll
    write queries for selecting data from the database using LINQ support that's available in the
    &lt;a href="http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/" type="external"&gt;F# PowerPack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F# features&lt;/strong&gt; - The application also uses some nice F# features that are 
    quite useful for developing web applications. We'll use modules and records to implement the
    model and we'll also use advanced meta-programming features for constructing LINQ queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use F# for creating an MVC application, you have a few options. It should be 
  possible to create the web application solely as an F# project. However, we'll use a more convenient
  approach. We'll create a standard C# MVC project and move all the actual implementation to 
  an F# library. We'll look at the application structure shortly. The following screenshot shows
  a page that lists products in the Northwind database:&lt;/p&gt;

In this article we'll look how to use asynchronous workflows for elegantly expressing the control flow of interaction with the user. We'll also look at clear functional way for encoding drag and drop-like algorithm.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Numerous Manning partners already published several exceprts from my &lt;a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek/" target="external"&gt;Real-World Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt; book. You can find a list on the &lt;a href="http://functional-programming.net/" type="external"&gt;book's web page&lt;/a&gt;. However, the last excerpt published &lt;a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx" type="external"&gt;at DotNetSlackers&lt;/a&gt; is particularly interesting. It discusses how to use F# asynchronous workflows to write GUI applications. This is a very powerful programming pattern that is very difficult to do in any other .NET language. We first discussed it with Don Syme during my internship at Microsoft Research and I found it very elegant, so I made some space for it in the book. In fact, the entire Chapter 16 discusses various reactive programming techniques that can be used in F#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/excerpt-gui-workflows/app.png" style="margin:15px;float:right;" /&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;"&gt;When designing applications that don't react to external events, you have lots of control flow constructs available, such as if-then-else expressions, for loops and while loops in imperative languages, or recursion and higher-order functions in functional languages. Constructs like this make it easy to describe what the application does. The control flow is clearly visible in the source code, so drawing a flowchart to describe it is straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;"&gt;Understanding reactive applications is much more difficult. A typical C# application or GUI control that needs to react to multiple events usually involves mutable state. When an event occurs, it updates the state and may run more code in response to the event, depending on the current state. This architecture makes it quite difficult to understand the potential states of the application and the transitions between them. Using asynchronous workflows, we can write the code in a way that makes the control flow of the application visible even for reactive applications.&lt;/p&gt;

However, there are other potentially useful implementations of grouping. For example, we may want to group only adjacent elements or group ascending or descending parts of the data. This article shows how to use custom behavior when grouping data using "group by" in LINQ query.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;You can use LINQ to write queries that perform grouping of data using &lt;code&gt;group by&lt;/code&gt;
  or ordering of data using &lt;code&gt;orderby&lt;/code&gt; clause. LINQ provides the default
  (and the most common) implementation of both of the operations, but sometimes you 
  may need a slightly different behavior when grouping or ordering data (this article
  is motivated by a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2194761/can-i-use-linq-to-retrieve-only-on-change-values" type="external"&gt;question on StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;
  which needs to do exactly that for grouping).&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a simple example, which shows when we may need a different behavior when 
  grouping data. For example, we may have the following list of stock trades
  containing a name of a stock and the price of the trade (stored for example as a list
  of &lt;code&gt;TradeInfo&lt;/code&gt; classes with properties &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Price&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;pre lang="csharp"&gt;
{ { Name = "MSFT", Price = 80.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 70.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 100.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 200.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 300.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 30.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 20.00 } }&lt;/pre&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Now, we may want to group adjacent trades into a single summary record which will contain
  the name of the stock (which is same for all trades in each group), the number of trades 
  in the group and an average price in the group. The desired results are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang="csharp"&gt;
{ { Name = "MSFT", Count = 2, AvgPrice = 75.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Count = 3, AvgPrice = 200.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Count = 2, AvgPrice = 25.00 } }&lt;/pre&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The operation that we want to do is very similar to &lt;code&gt;group by&lt;/code&gt; in LINQ, but 
  it doesn't do quite the same thing! If we used &lt;code&gt;group by&lt;/code&gt;, we would get only 
  two groups as the result. However, as I wrote earlier, we want to group only 
  &lt;em&gt;adjacent trades&lt;/em&gt;. You could write your own extension method to do this,
  but then you need to leave the elegant LINQ query syntax. In this article, I'll show
  you how to get the desired results using a simple LINQ query with a &lt;code&gt;group by&lt;/code&gt;
  clause...&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Deal of the day: Real-World Functional Programming</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/book-deal.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2010 17:00:41 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">Some time ago, I received my copies of &lt;strong&gt;Real-World Functional Programming&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the book is to present functional programming concepts and ideas in a readable form. I wanted to create a book that will teach you how to &lt;em&gt;think functionally&lt;/em&gt; without using the usual &lt;em&gt;shock therapy&lt;/em&gt; that people usually feel when seeing functional programming for the first time. There are already a couple of reviews that suggest I was quite successful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Functional Programming for the Real World, by Tomas Petricek and Jon Skeet, has been a very helpful book for moving to F# from C#, as the authors do a fantastic job of helping to explain the differences between OOP and FP. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;This book isn’t just a simple introduction to programming in F#; it’s an introductory text on functional programming covering the many reasons why it is time for this programming paradigm to finally be accepted by mainstream programmers. And it also contains much more... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In this article, we'll look at building complex data-parallel programs with F# quotations, we'll implement blur filter and we'll also discuss architecture and performance.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In this article series, we're talking about the Accelerator project and I'm 
  presenting an F# library that I implemented, which allows you to use Accelerator [&lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-quotations.aspx#accelfsh4links"&gt;references&lt;/a&gt;]
  in a more sophisticated way. We've seen two examples of using Accelerator directly
  (see also &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx"&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx"&gt;Game of Life&lt;/a&gt;).
  In the &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;
  I introduced my F# library for working with Accelerator. We've seen F# functions from the
  &lt;code&gt;DataParallel&lt;/code&gt; module, we implemented an algorithm that rotates an image
  using these functions and finally, we've seen that we can take this ordinary F# code
  and run it using Accelerator. This is all possible thanks to F# quotations, which 
  we can use to get an AST (a source code) of an F# function we wrote (if the function
  is marked in some special way).&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/accelerator-quotations/blur.png" alt="Blurred photo of Prague" style="float:right; margin:10px" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this part of the series, we're going to look at working with quotations explicitly.
  We'll use meta-programming techniques to work with Accelerator. Meta-programming means
  writing programs that manipulate with other programs or pieces of code. This is exactly
  what we're going to do in this article. We'll write an F# function (running on CPU) that
  builds a program, which we'll then run using Accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite interesting approach, which isn't possible when we call Accelerator
  methods as standard F# functions or .NET methods. The benefit is that we'll 
  clearly see which parts of program run on CPU and what parts execute on GPU or using
  X64 multi-core target. We could also perform more complicated optimizations with 
  the code (because this wouldn't affect the readability). Just for your reference, here is the list
  of articles in this series in case you missed some of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerator and F# (IV.): Composing computations with quotations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;However, enough with theory and let's take a look at some code samples! 
  This time, we'll implement blurring of an image (also called convolution). 
  Another example how to write this in F# using Accelerator is Satnam Singh's blog 
  post [&lt;a href="#accelfsh4links"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]. Our example will be different, because we'll
  write the code as standard F# program and then have it translated to Accelerator
  automatically using quotations. We'll also talk about the architecture
  of the library that we're using and look at some performance results.&lt;/p&gt;

  that Accelerator is a MSR library [&lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx#accelfsh3links"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#accelfsh3links"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;] 
  that allows you to run code in parallel on either multi-core CPU or using 
  shaders on GPU (see &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx"&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt;).
  We also discussed a direct way to use Accelerator from F# (by calling Accelerator methods
  directly) and &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx"&gt;implemented Conway's Game of Life&lt;/a&gt;.
  In this article, we'll look at more sophisticated way of using Accelerator from F#.
  We'll introduce F# quotations and look at translating 'normal' F# code to use
  Accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/accelerator-dataparallel/rotated.png" alt="Rotated Prague photo" style="float:right; margin:10px" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, F# quotations allow us to treat F# code as data structure and manipulate 
  with it. This is very similar to C# expression trees, but the F# implementation is 
  more powerful. We can also mark a standard method or a function with a special attribute
  that tells the compiler to store quotation of the body. Then we can access the
  quotation and traverse it or modify it. In this article we'll use a function that
  takes an F# quotation (containing a limited set of functions) and executes it using
  MSR Accelerator. Implementing this functionality is a bit complicated, so we won't
  discuss the implementation now. We'll leave this for some future article of this series.
  In future, we'll also look at other interesting possibilities that we have when 
  writing code using quotations. Here is a list of articles in this series and of the
  articles that I'm planning to add:&lt;/p&gt;

  Microsoft Research Accelerator library. It allows us to write computations with arrays
  in C# and execute them in parallel on multi-core CPU or more interestingly, 
  using GPU shaders. In the previous artcile, we've seen how Accelerator works and 
  how it can be accessed from F#. In this article, we'll look at one more interesting
  F# demo - we'll implement the famous Conway's Game of Life [&lt;a href="accelerator-life-game.aspx#accelfsh2links"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] using Accelerator.
  We'll use a v2 version of Accelerator which has been announced just recently and
  is available from Microsoft Connect [&lt;a href="accelerator-life-game.aspx#accelfsh2links"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is the second one from a series about using Accelerator from F#. 
  Today, we'll use Accelerator types directly from F# - this is the simplest possible 
  approach and is very similar to the way you'd work with Accelerator in C#. However, 
  we can use some nice F# features such as custom operators to make the code more 
  readable. In the next article, we'll discuss a different approach - we'll look how
  to execute more "standard" F# code (that doesn't reference Accelerator explicitly)
  with Accelerator using F# quotations. The list of articles may change, but here is 
  a list of articles that I'm currently planning to write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already wrote about two projects that I worked on during an internship at
  MSR back in 2007 (&lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/aspnet-in-fsharp.aspx" type="external"&gt;ASP.NET support in F#&lt;/a&gt; and
  &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fswebtools-intro.aspx" type="external"&gt;F# WebTools&lt;/a&gt;).
  Even though this was more than 2 years ago (and I did one more internship at MSR in the meantime),
  I still have one more project that I never published on the web. The folks from the F# team
  reminded me of this project recently, so I thought I could finally publish it. The project 
  used Microsoft Research Accelerator [&lt;a href="#accelfsh1links"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#accelfsh1links"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;], 
  which is a C# library for developing array-based computations and executing them on a GPU. 
  More recently, the Accelerator team at MSR published Accelerator v2 [&lt;a href="#accelfsh1links"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;],
  which was a good motivation to update my original project...&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we'll look at the simplest way of using Accelerator from F#. Accelerator
  provides a managed interface that can be naturally used from both C# and F#. We can use
  a mix of method calls and overloaded operators to describe a computation. In F#, we'll also 
  define our additional custom operators to make the code a bit nicer. After we introduce
  Accelerator using a simple C# demo, we'll look how to calculate an approximate value of
  the PI number using a Monte-Carlo method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is the first one from a series about using Accelerator from F#. The list
  of articles may change, but here is a list of articles that I'm currently planning to write:&lt;/p&gt;

  month or so, we were doing the final edits, reviewing the final PDF version (I fixed quite a lot minor 
  issues, synchronized book with the Beta 2 F# release and so on). Anyway, before a few days, I received the following

Dear Tomas Petricek, &lt;br /&gt;
We are pleased to announce that &lt;strong&gt;Real-World Functional Programming&lt;/strong&gt; is now complete! As a MEAP subscriber 
you can download your copy of the finished ebook right now! (...) This ebook is the final version, 
identical to the softbound edition, which is currently being printed and will be available on &lt;strong&gt;December 24&lt;/strong&gt;. 
If you chose the printed book option when you originally subscribed, we'll ship it to you automatically—no action required 
from you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finally finished!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's right. The book is finally completed and as far as I know, it has been printed last week! If you already 
  ordered the book, you won't receive it before Christmas, but it should come shortly after. I can't wait to see the
  book actually &lt;em&gt;printed&lt;/em&gt;. The transition from the Word drafts I initially wrote to a final PDF version
  was already felt fantastic and I thought &lt;em&gt;"It looks like a real book!"&lt;/em&gt; Among other things, there are now 
  graphical arrows with comments inside listings, which looks really great and makes code listings much easier to read.
  Now I can look forward to seeing the &lt;em&gt;actual book&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe I'm too conservative, but I have to say that I'm 
  really glad that I wrote the book before everything is going to be published just electronically!&lt;/p&gt;

The demo uses script for processing RSS feeds from the previous webcast.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous parts of this webcast series we've developed an F# script that downloads RSS feeds
  asynchronously and in parallel and searches them for the specified keywords. We followed the usual F#
  development style, so after introducing &lt;a href="fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx"&gt;the basic functional 
  concepts&lt;/a&gt;, we wrote the code in &lt;a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx"&gt;the simples possible style&lt;/a&gt; 
  and demonstrated how to use &lt;code&gt;System.Xml&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;System.Net&lt;/code&gt; namespaces. Then we 
  &lt;a href="fsharp-webcast-async.aspx"&gt;refactored the existing code&lt;/a&gt;, to run asynchronously and process
  the results potentially in parallel, which was very easy thanks to F# &lt;em&gt;asynchronous workflows&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part of the series, we'll make the next evolutionary step of our sample application. We'll turn
  the code that originally used F# tuples and lists into code that uses standard .NET objects and we'll
  also see how to declare a class in F#. This simple modification will turn the script into an F# library
  that is almost indistinguishable from a library developed in C#. We'll also look how you can use the library
  from C# web application to show the interop between C# and F# in practice. We'll start
  with the code from the &lt;a href="fsharp-webcast-async.aspx"&gt;previous part&lt;/a&gt;, so if you missed that, you
  may want to check it out or download the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

  processing RSS feeds that I presented in &lt;a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx"&gt;the second part&lt;/a&gt; 
  (if you didn't see earlier parts, &lt;a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx"&gt;the first one&lt;/a&gt; was an introduction to 
  basic functional ideas). The previous part demonstrated how to use .NET libraries
  and we implemented a simple &lt;code&gt;downloadUrl&lt;/code&gt; function for obtaining content
  of from the web and we've also seen how to load the data into an XML document object
  and how to filter items. In this part, we'll modify the code to run asynchronously and 
  potentially in parallel. To use some of the functionality, you'll need to get 
  &lt;code&gt;FSharp.PowerPack.dll&lt;/code&gt;, which is available with the VS 2008 installation or
  as a separated download for VS 2010 [&lt;a href="#fswc_asy"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;].
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the first version of the code, we can start &lt;em&gt;refactoring&lt;/em&gt; it.
  I'm using the term in a slightly vague meaning - we're of course going to change the
  behavior of the code. We'll wrap it into F# &lt;em&gt;asynchronous workflow&lt;/em&gt; to run
  without blocking threads and we'll also run multiple downloads in parallel. However,
  this can still be viewed as refactoring in some sense, because we're not changing
  the &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt; behavior of the code. As you can see from the webcast, these kinds of
  refactorings are also very nicely supported by F# syntax...&lt;/p&gt;

  It focused on explainining the basic ideas behind functional programming such as immutability, recursion
  and passing functions as arguments to other functions (or methods in C#). In the first part, we've seen some
  C# code to demonstrate the ideas and also a bit of F#, mainly to show the basic language features.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part is going to be exclusively about F#. It'll demonstrate how we can start writing
  a demo application that grabs data from RSS feeds and processes them. You'll learn how to access
  .NET libraries from F# (in particular, we'll use &lt;code&gt;System.Net&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;System.Xml&lt;/code&gt;).
  We'll develop the code iteratively, which means that we'll start by simply enumerating the RSS elements using &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop and printing the results and then we'll refactor the code to use &lt;em&gt;tuples&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sequence expressions&lt;/em&gt; to turn it into processing code that generates a sequence of feed items. Finally we'll also demonstrate how to use some of the functions from the previous part such as &lt;code&gt;List.filter&lt;/code&gt; in practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>F# Webcast (I.) - Introducing functional concepts</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2009 13:39:54 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">Now that Visual Studio 2010 beta 1 is out, it may be a good time finally try the new F# language.

  quite a long time now as Microsoft Research project, but is now becoming a real Microsoft product.
  Interestingly, F# is still available as a &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;amp;FamilyID=7bb32f32-9fac-4f34-ad56-b0bda130cf00" type="external"&gt;plugin for Visual Studio 2008&lt;/a&gt;, so if you want to try it
  you don't have to install the whole new beta of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already many resources for learning F# including my &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-overview.aspx"&gt;functional programming overview&lt;/a&gt;,

  official &lt;a href="http://www.fsharp.net"&gt;F# web site&lt;/a&gt; including some talk recordings. However, I haven't yet seen any good F# webcast focusing

  This time, I was in Cambridge for 6 months from October until April, so it has been more than a month since 
  I left, but as you can guess I didn't have time to write anything about the internship until now... There isn't
  much to say though, because the internship was simply fantastic. Cambridge is a beautiful place (here are

  the Microsoft Research lab in Cambridge is full of smart people, so it is a perferct working environment
  (except that you realize that you're not as clever as you think :-)). Also, it is just a few meters away from the
  &lt;a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk" type="external"&gt;Computer Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; of the Cambridge University, so there are always many 
  interesting talks and seminars. So, big thanks to Don Syme, James Margetson and everyone else who I had a chance 
  to work with during the internship.&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why I didn't have much time to write about the internship earlier is that I
  was invited to the &lt;a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/" type="external"&gt;Lang.NET Symposium&lt;/a&gt; shortly
  after the end of the internship. I had a chance to talk about my project there as well and there is

In this article, we'll add support for 'break' and 'continue'.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;As I already wrote in the &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/imperative-i-return.aspx"&gt;first part of this series&lt;/a&gt;,
  the F# language doesn't support some of the language constructs known from imperative
  languages such as C#. In particular, we cannot use imperative &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement
  that returns the result of a function from any place in the function code. In functional languages,
  every construct is an expression, so to get the overall result of the function, the 
  F# language evaluates the expression and the value of the expression is used as the result.
  In the previous article, we've seen that we can simulate this construct in the F# language
  using F# computation expressions and I showed how to implement computation named &lt;code&gt;imperative&lt;/code&gt;
  that allows us to write for example the &lt;code&gt;exists&lt;/code&gt; function for working with sequences
  like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang="fsharp"&gt;
let exists f inp = imperative {
  for v in inp do 
    if f(v) then return true
  return false }
&lt;/pre&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we're going to look at two more imperative constructs and we're going
  to talk about &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;. We'll see that we can quite
  easily extend the computation builder from the previous article to allow writing code
  that is syntactically very close to what you would write in C#. As I already mentioned,
  there are of course some performance overheads when using computation expressions, but 
  I find it very interesting how nice imperative syntax we can get in functional F#:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang="fsharp"&gt;
imperative { 
  for x in 1 .. 10 do 
    if (x % 3 = 0) then do! continue
    printfn "number = %d" x }
&lt;/pre&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The only difference between this code and the code we'd probably write if F# supported
  &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; as a keyword is that we need to wrap the code inside the &lt;code&gt;imperative&lt;/code&gt;
  computation and that we need to add the &lt;code&gt;do!&lt;/code&gt; primitive before the &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;
  value. Now that we've seen an example of using the &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; value inside
  the imperative computations, let's look how we can extend the computation builder from
  the previous article to add this feature...&lt;/p&gt;

In this series, we'll look how we can implement these constructs ourselves using F# computation expressions.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the limitations of F# is that it doesn't very well support some of the 
  advanced imperative language constructs such as &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;
  or imperative style of returning value from a function, meaning that you can't write
  something like &lt;code&gt;return false&lt;/code&gt; in the middle of the function. This has 
  good reasons. F# doesn't in principle have the notion of &lt;em&gt;currently executing statement&lt;/em&gt;
  and instead treat every code you write as an expression. Clearly, when there is no 
  &lt;em&gt;current statement&lt;/em&gt;, we cannot jump to other statements. If you're looking
  for more information about these basic principles, you can take a look at my book 
  &lt;a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" target="external"&gt;Real World Functional 
  Programming&lt;/a&gt;, which covers this distinction in details in chapter 2, but we'll look 
  at a brief example that will clarify this idea shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, there is really no need to use &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; or other imperative constructs
  in F#, because you can write the same thing more elegantly using one of the provided higher
  order function such as &lt;code&gt;Seq.exists&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Seq.tryfind&lt;/code&gt;. However,
  there are still some cases where the imperative programming style makes it easier 
  to express our original intention. Also, implementing your own higher order
  functions (akin to &lt;code&gt;Seq.exists&lt;/code&gt;) would sometimes be much easier if we
  could just use imperative return.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;So, what can be done about this?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Real World Functional Programming: Second review finished!</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-2nd-review.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2009 00:40:50 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">I've been working on the &lt;a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" target="external"&gt;Real World Functional programming in .NET&lt;/a&gt; book for quite some time now.

It introduces the benefits of functional pogramming, and explains the essential aspects of the functional style using F# and C# 3.0. Finally, it also shows how functional style influences the application architecture.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
  Functional programming languages have been around for a while and were always astonishing for their 
  ability to express the ideas in a succinct, declarative way allowing the developer to focus on the 
  essence of problem rather than on technical details of the solution. Recently, functional paradigm is 
  gaining new prominence as an efficient way to handle development of multi-processor, parallel and 
  asynchronous applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Functional ideas are arising in C# as well as in other main-stream languages and functional languages 
  are becoming an alternative for real-world projects.  Also, Microsoft recently introduced a new 
  language called F#, which has a strong background in traditional functional languages, but as a .NET 
  language also benefits from the rich .NET and Visual Studio ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  This article is partially an excerpt from my book &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek"&gt;Real-world Functional Programming in .NET&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;a href="#fpgpref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]. 
  Thanks to my editors at &lt;a href="http://www.manning.com" type="external"&gt;Manning&lt;/a&gt; I have the permission
  to publish it on my blog. We’ll look at several aspects of functional programming and how the same 
  concepts, which are essential for the functional paradigm, look in the F# and in C# 3.0 with LINQ. We 
  will shortly look at the basic programming language features like lambda functions and type inference 
  that are now available in both F# and C#. Functional programming isn’t only about language features, 
  but also about using different programming style, so we’ll look at some high level concepts as well. 
  These include using immutable data structures for developing code that can be executed in parallel 
  and writing code in a more declarative style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Thanks to the combination of C# 3.0 and F#, this article shows the ideas in a way that should be 
  familiar to you in C#, but also shows a further step that you can take with a primarilly functional
  language F#. If you're a .NET developer and you want to understand what functional programming is
  and how it can help you to become better and more productive then continue reading. If you'll find 
  this article interesting, then don't forget to check out the &lt;a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;,
  which explains everything in larger detail and discusses many other interesting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

  implement a slightly more complicated application using the library that I introduced
  in the previous three articles. We're going to use basic event stream queries from the &lt;a href="reactive-ii-csevents.aspx"&gt;second article&lt;/a&gt; 
  as well as advanced operators introduced in the &lt;a href="reactive-iii-linqoperators.aspx"&gt;third part&lt;/a&gt;.
  This time, I'll also show the F# version of all the examples, so we're going to build on the ideas from
  the &lt;a href="reactive-i-fsevents.aspx"&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally wanted to write the demo only in Visual Basic, because I think that
  it is really amazig to show an idea that came from functional programming in a language
  that no one (maybe until recently) connects with functional programming. Then I realized that
  I really want to show the F# version too, because F# was an inspiration for the whole
  &lt;strong&gt;Reactive LINQ&lt;/strong&gt; idea and it is interesting alone as well. But finally,
  I thought that don't showing the C# version may look offensive to many readers (especially 
  since I'm still C# MVP...). So, I ended up writing the game in all three languages, but 
  the code is surprisingly similar in all of them!&lt;/p&gt;

Today, we're going to look at other operators that canbe used for working with events. We'll see aggregation is useful and how to dynamically change (switch) behavior.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="reactive-ii-csevents.aspx"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, I introduced &lt;strong&gt;Reactive LINQ&lt;/strong&gt;.
  I explained the different point of view that we can use when working with .NET events. The idea is that
  .NET events can be viewed as streams of values. The value is information about the event (such as position
  of a mouse click or a mouse movement). These streams can be processed using LINQ queries - we can for example
  filter all values that are not interesting for us using &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; LINQ clause. For example if we want to handle
  clicks only in some specified area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous article, I talked about basic LINQ query operators such as &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt;
  and some useful methods that &lt;strong&gt;Reactive LINQ&lt;/strong&gt; provides (for example for merging event streams).
  Today, we'll take a look at two more advanced kinds of operations that we can use for working with event streams. 
  In particular, we'll talk about aggregation operators (that you certainly know from LINQ) and about switching. 
  Switching is a concept from functional reactive programming and it allows us to change dynamically how the 
  application behaves. However, I'll explain this in a more detail soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'm going to use mostly C# (and some Visual Basic). The functionality that I'm describing
  in this part isn't part of the standard F# &lt;code&gt;Event&lt;/code&gt; module that I discussed in 
  &lt;a href="reactive-i-fsevents.aspx"&gt;the first part&lt;/a&gt;. I implemented most of them in F# too, but I'm not going
  to write the samples in both of the versions in this part. If you've seen the first two articles, you'll be 
  definitely able to use the F# versions as well, because they follow exactly the same ideas as the C#/LINQ versions.
  I'm going to talk about a larger demo application in the last section and I'll show an F# version as well,
  so you'll see some F# examples in the next part. This part serves more as a reference of the available
  operators, so you may read only some parts of it, then jump to the last one (to see an exciting example!) 
  and then come back here.&lt;/p&gt;

This is largely inspired
  by the ideas that come from functional reactive programming in the Haskell language and from 
  functionality that's available for working in events in F#. I introduced these ideas in my previous article
  in this mini-series, so if you're interested in learning more about these interesting technologies, you 
  should definitely read the previous article about &lt;a href="reactive-i-fsevents.aspx"&gt;First class events in F#&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we're going to look how to apply the same ideas to the C# language and how 
  to use LINQ queries for processing events. This article is &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx"&gt;just&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async.aspx"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; my article that shows how to implement some 
  idea from functional programmin in C#. I believe this will once again show that the new features
  in the C# 3.0 aren't just about querying databases, but are more widely useful even in situations 
  that are not directly related to data-processing. &lt;/p&gt;  </description></item><item><title>Reactive programming (I.) - First class events in F#</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-i-fsevents.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2008 17:14:04 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">The LINQ project and changes in C# 3.0 are interesting because they allow implementing many ideas from functional languages in C#.

  allow rewriting of many ideas from functional programming. An ability to express queries easily
  is one of these ideas, but it is definitely not the only one. There are many other interesting ideas.
  The C# 3.0 language isn't primary a functional language, so it isn't easy to discover the idea
  if you use only C#, but it is possible to implement it if you know the idea already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already wrote a few interesting C# examples that were inspired by some functional idea.
  I'm a big fan of the F# language, so it is not a surprise that I started with an F# version
  of the problem and then looked at the way to do the same thing in C#. In particular, this is 
  how my article about building dynamic queries in C# came to the existence - the F# version used
  &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-flinq.aspx"&gt;FLINQ and Quotations&lt;/a&gt; and then I demonstrated how to do the same in &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx"&gt;C# 
  using expression trees&lt;/a&gt;. Another example is my article about asynchronous 
  programming in C# &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async.aspx"&gt;using iterators&lt;/a&gt;, which shows how to implement something 
  like F# &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/10/11/introducing-f-asynchronous-workflows.aspx"&gt;asynchronous workflows using iterators&lt;/a&gt; in C# 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Functional Reactive Programming&lt;/h3&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm going to look at another very interesting idea from functional programming. It is 
  called &lt;em&gt;Functional Reactive Programming&lt;/em&gt; and it comes from the Haskell community. You can find 
  a list of related &lt;a href="http://www.haskell.org/frp/" type="external"&gt;Haskell projects here&lt;/a&gt;.
  However, similar things (though they are not purely functional and simplified) are available 
  in the F# language as well. Don Syme introduced them in his blog post called 
  &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2006/03/24/559582.aspx"&gt;F# First Class Events: Simplicity and Compositionality in Imperative Reactive Programming&lt;/a&gt;. In this article, I'm going to briefly introduce the implementation
  available in F# and I'll extend it a little bit to allow some more interesting things. In the 
  second article from this series, I'll show how to implement the same thing in C# 3.0 (and in VB 9 too!)&lt;/p&gt;

It was published by the C# Community PM &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/" type="external"&gt;Charlie Calvert&lt;/a&gt; at the C# Developer Center. The article was a first of two articles where I wanted to demonstrate that C# 3.0 can be used for implementing useful constructs known from functional languages. I realized that I never posted the link to the second article to my blog, so you can find the annotation and link below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I remembered about these two articles because I was just working on chapters 11 and 12 of the &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-net-update.aspx"&gt;Real-world Functional Programming in .NET&lt;/a&gt; book that I’m writing. Lazy values, which were the topic of my first article, are discussed in the second part of chapter 11 and IEnumerable and F# sequences are the topic for the first part of chapter 12. Because I already wrote two articles on this topic, I had to think really hard to find better (and still simple enough) examples where these concepts are useful in practice. I also finally have enough space to show how these two concepts relate and talk about some interesting background – for example in Haskell, lazy sequences are in fact just ordinary lists that are lazy thanks to the Haskell nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I definitely wouldn’t believe that today, I’ll be writing about the same topics, but this time as part of a book that has partly the same goal as these two articles – to show that functional programming ideas are really useful in the real-world and can enrich your programming toolbox (no matter whether you’re using C# or F# language). Anyway, here is the link to the second article – as usual when I look at something that I worked on a long time ago, I think I should rewrite it to make it better :-), but it still gives you an idea what is the book that I’m working on about...&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Functional Programming in .NET book - An update</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-net-update.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2008 22:10:04 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">Recently, I announced on my blog that I’m working on a book for Manning called Real-world Functional Programming in .NET.

  called &lt;em&gt;Real world Functional Programming in .NET&lt;/em&gt;. The goal of the book is to explain the most interesting and
  useful ideas of functional programming to a real world C# developer. I'm writing this book, because I believe that functional programming is becoming
  increasingly important. Here is a couple of reasons why you should have this book on your bookshelf:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideas behind C# 3.0 and LINQ&lt;/strong&gt; - these main-stream technologies are inspired by functional programming and the new 
    C# 3.0 features give us definitely much more than just a new way to query databases. The book explains
    the ideas behind these features and shows how to use them more efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
    
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning the F# language&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/10/17/f-a-functional-programming-language.aspx" type="external"&gt;F# is becoming a first-class citizen&lt;/a&gt;
    in the Visual Studio family of languages, which alone would be a good reason for learning it! Even if you're not going
    to use it for your next large .NET project, you'll find it useful for quick prototyping of ideas and testing how .NET libraries
    work thanks to the great interactive tools.
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real world examples&lt;/strong&gt; - the book includes a large set of real-world examples that show how to develop 
    real applications in a functional way - both in F# and C#. Among other things, the examples show how to utilize multi-core 
    CPUs, how to better obtain and process data and how to implement animations and GUI applications in a functional way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;The book is available via the MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) and if you want to get a better idea what is the book about, 
  you can read the &lt;a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek/" type="external"&gt;first chapter for free&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, it is more than a month since I  &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-programming-book.aspx"&gt;posted the announcement&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to write a brief update....&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcing: Real-world Functional Programming in .NET</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-programming-book.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2008 20:03:15 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">If you’ve been reading my blog or seen some my articles, you know that I’m a big fan of the F# language and functional programming style.

I’m also often trying to present a bit different view of C# and LINQ – for me it is interesting mainly because it brings many functional features to a main-stream language and allows using of many of the functional patterns in a real-world. Elegant way for working with data, which is the most commonly used feature of C# 3.0, is just one example of this functional approach. Talking about real-world applications of functional programming, there is also fantastic news about F#. It was announced last year that F# will become fully supported Visual Studio language and the first CTP version of F# was released this week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always thought that the topics mentioned in the previous paragraph are really interesting and that functional programming will continue to become more and more important.

  this is often a reason for never-ending discussions). In this article, I'll try to show one interesting
  example, which demonstrates that these two groups are not in fact that distinct and that you can implement
  a common &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; language feature in F#, which is undoubtedly &lt;em&gt;statically-typed&lt;/em&gt;.
  The feature that I'm talking about is dynamic invoke using a symbolic representation of the member
  (this is something that can be done using &lt;em&gt;symbols&lt;/em&gt; in Ruby, but I'll shortly explain what exactly I mean).&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I intentionally wrote &lt;em&gt;statically-typed&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;dynamically-typed&lt;/em&gt;.
  In my understanding &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; is a broader term while &lt;em&gt;dynamically-typed&lt;/em&gt; and 
  &lt;em&gt;statically-typed&lt;/em&gt; are of course two distinct groups. On the other side &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; refers
  to language features that are usually available in &lt;em&gt;dynamically-typed&lt;/em&gt; languages, just because
  it is easy to support them in a nice way. This doesn't mean that having a &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; feature in
  a &lt;em&gt;statically-typed&lt;/em&gt; language would be impossible - it is just more difficult to implement it in 
  a way that would be similarly elegant.

The thesis is about a client/server web framework for F# called F# WebTools, which I already &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fswebtools-intro.aspx" type="external"&gt;mentioned here&lt;/a&gt; and its abstract is following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;"&gt;“Ajax” programming is becoming a de-facto standard for certain types of web applications, but unfortunately developing this kind of application is a difficult task. Developers have to deal with problems like a language impedance mismatch, limited execution runtime in web browser on the client-side and no integration between client and server-side parts that are developed as a two independent applications, but typically form a single and homogenous application. In this work we present the first project that deals with all three mentioned problems but which still integrates with existing web technologies such as ASP.NET on the server and JavaScript on the client. We use the F# language for writing both client and server-side part of the web application, which makes it possible to develop client-side code in a type-safe programming language using a subset of the F# library, and we provide a way to write both server-side and client-side code as a part of single homogeneous type defining the web page logic. The code is executed heterogeneously, part as JavaScript on the client, and part as native code on the server. Finally we use monadic syntax for the separation of client and server-side code, tracking this separation through the F# type system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-indent:0px"&gt;The full text is available here: &lt;a href="/articles/webtools-thesis/fswebtools.pdf"&gt;Client side scripting using meta-programming&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, 1.31MB)

  in Phalanger. I already posted the presentation and samples on the blog (&lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/phalanger-at-langnet.aspx" type="external"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)
  and the talk is also available as a video on the Lang.NET web site (&lt;a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/talks.asp" type="external"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
  - actually, due to the huge demand the site is down now, but I hope it gets back soon!) Anyway, the most interesting thing is that
  I've used Phalanger Integration for &lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio 2008&lt;/strong&gt; during the talk, which wasn't available in any Phalanger release until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to mention one more thing before talking more about the new release - Phalanger Integration for VS 2008 works with Visual Studio Shell, 
  which means that you can get &lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio 2008 with Phalanger Support for free!&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, that's right. Microsoft offers
  so called Visual Studio 2008 Shell, which is an "empty" IDE with no integrated languages and you can install Phalanger Integration into
  this version, which means that you can get very good Phalanger IDE (for Windows) for no cost at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't wait to install this new version, you can skip the overview article and &lt;a href="/blog/phalanger-vs2008.aspx#phpm08down"&gt;go directly to the installation links&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  a new implementation of the CodeDOM provider for the F# language which makes it possible to use ASP.NET
  smoothly from F# (but it can be used in some other scenarios as well) together with two ASP.NET sample
  applications that you can explore and use as a basis for your web sites. This was actually a part of the

By the way – during the trip from Prague to Seattle I missed a connecting flight from Paris, so I had one day to visit Paris and since I was traveling on Saturday I actually quite enjoyed it :-), so that’s where the picture comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it was really a fantastic event with many great talks from many interesting people. I hope that there will be recordings as a last year, so I won’t comment every topic that I found interesting (that would be really a long post). But just quickly – people from Microsoft often talked about DLR (dynamic language runtime) related topics, which was interesting as we’re planning to look at DLR in Phalanger. Luckily, &lt;a href="http://netevil.org/" type="external"&gt;Wez Furlong&lt;/a&gt; from the PHP community was there too, so we discussed how we could work on “PHP on DLR” project together (see also our &lt;a href="http://news.php.net/php.on.dlr" type="external"&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a target="_blank" href="/articles/phalanger-at-langnet/photo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:10px;border:0px" alt="Trip to Seattle" src="/articles/phalanger-at-langnet/photo_sm.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also two talks about F# (from &lt;a type="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lukeh"&gt;Luke Hoban&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.devhawk.net/" type="external"&gt;Harry Pierson&lt;/a&gt;), and it was a lot of fun to hang out with them. Finally, Erik Meijer presented the &lt;a href="http://labs.live.com/volta" type="external"&gt;Volta&lt;/a&gt; project, which I was particularly interested in as it shares many goals and ideas with my F# Web Tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-Microsoft talks covered wider range of topics including Mono and Moonlight project (by &lt;a href="http://tirania.org/blog" type="external"&gt;Miguel de Icaza&lt;/a&gt;) and I actually had a chance to talk with Miguel about Phalanger and we even tried running the Helicopter sample on Moonlight – there were some issues, but it seems quite promising, so I hope to have the sample running on Moonlight on Linux quite soon! Miguel mentioned that the installation of Moonlight is currently a bit painful (due to some issues with media codecs), but it should be fixed in next few weeks, so I hope to be able to try it on my machine too!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Writing Silverlight applications in PHP</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/php-in-silverlight.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2007 17:16:14 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">In this article we will look how Phalanger can be used for developing Silverlight applications in the PHP language.

  that our important goal is to support the Silverlight (2.0) platform. Shortly Silverlight is a cross-browser 
  platform that can be used for developing client-side components that run in the web browser and contain
  rich media, graphics and can interactively communicate with the user. The language that can be used for
  writing Silverlight code can be in general any .NET language, so our goal is to allow using PHP by 
  making Phalanger compatible with Silverlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/articles/php-in-silverlight/car_intro_sm.png" alt="Simple Silverlight App in PHP" style="margin:10px; float:left;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First steps were already made and it is becoming possible to write some very interesting things in 
  Silverlight using PHP, there is of course still a lot of work to do and we're discussing the future 
  development with PHP development team (you can join the mailing list &lt;a href="http://news.php.net/php.on.dlr" type="external"&gt;PHP on DLR&lt;/a&gt; for more info).
  In this article we will first show a very basic Silverlight example that uses PHP and later I will 
  shortly comment more complicated example - a game (quite addicting, so be careful :-)!) where you have to 
  fly with helicopter and avoid the walls. The source code for helicopter game is also attached, so feel free
  to modify it or create similar games!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't wait to try the demos before looking at the sources, here are the links:&lt;/p&gt;

  if you look at some things in our world you can see many similarities with fractals (but not quite as ideal
  with the infinite level of precision). One of my favorite fractals is 3D version of Sierpinski carpet [&lt;a href="#wpffractref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;],
  which itself is based on very famous Cantor set. Quite long time ago I thought that it would be nice to 
  implement animation of flying through this fractal, but I was never good in 3D graphics and it looked like a lot of work,
  so I never get to doing it. Luckily, now with F#, which makes it very easy to write the code to generate the fractal and
  with WPF 3D, which can be easily used to animate the fractal, I finally had everything I needed to do it, so here it is!

  the typical inversion of control. To briefly introduce what I mean by 'asynchronous' and 
  'inversion of control' - asynchronous refers to programs that perform some long running operations 
  that don't necessary block a calling thread, for example accessing the network, calling web services 
  or performing any other I/O operation in general. The inversion of control refers to the code structure 
  that you have to use when writing a code that explicitly passes a C# delegate as a callback to the
  asynchronous method (typically called &lt;code&gt;Begin&lt;em&gt;Something&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in .NET). The asynchronous method
  calls the delegate when the operation completes, which reverses the way you write the code - instead of
  encoding the control flow using typical language constructs (e.g. &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop) you have to 
  use global variables and write your own control mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing about this article is that it could have been written at least 3 years ago when
  a beta version of Visual Studio 2005 and C# 2.0 became first available, but it is using iterators in 
  a slightly bizarre way, so it is not easy to realize that this is possible. Actually, I will use some C# 3.0
  methods in the article as well, but only extension methods and mainly just to keep the code nicer. As with 
  my earlier article about building LINQ queries at runtime, I realized that it can be done in C# when I was playing with 
  the F# solution (called F# Asynchronous Workflows), where this approach is very natural, so I will shortly
  mention the F# implementation as well.&lt;/p&gt;

We will look how discriminated unions relate to this paradigm and at three specific features that support this paradigm, namely &lt;em&gt;active patterns&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;computation expressions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;quotations&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining precisely what the term &lt;em&gt;language oriented programming&lt;/em&gt; means in context of the F# language would be difficult,
  so I will instead explain a few examples that will demonstrate how I understand it. In general, the goal of language oriented
  programming is to develop a &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; that would be suitable for some (more specific) class of tasks and use this language 
  for solving these tasks. Of course, developing a real programming language is extremely complex problem, so there are several ways
  for making it easier. As the most elementary example, you can look at XML files (with certain schema) as language that 
  are processed by your program and solve some specific problem (for example configuring the application). As a side note,
  I should mention that I'm not particularly happy with the term ‘language’ in this context, because the term can be used
  for describing a wide range of techniques from very trivial constructs to a complex object-oriented class libraries, 
  but I have not seen any better term for the class of techniques that I’m going to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>F# Overview (III.) - Imperative and Object-Oriented Programming</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-iii-oop.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2007 00:00:03 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">In the third part of the F# overview, we will look at the F# features that are essential for a smooth interoperability with other .NET languages and form a second part of the F# core language - that is object oriented and imperative programming.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In the third part of the F# Overview article series, we will look at language features that are mostly well known, because they are present in most of the currently used programming languages.

We will first examine the standard F# data types, which are useful to allow the functional programming style and we will also look at a few functional tricks.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;As already mentioned in the &lt;a href="fsharp-i-introduction.aspx"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt; for this article series,
  F# is a typed functional language, by which I mean that types of all values are determined during the compile-time. 
  However, thanks to the use of a type inference, the types are explicitly specified in the code very rarely as we will see in the 
  following examples. Basic data types (aside from a standard set of primitive numeric and textual types that are present in any 
  .NET language) available in F# are tuple, discriminated union, record, array, list, function and object. In the following 
  quick overview, we will use the F# interactive, which is a tool that compiles and executes the entered text on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the articles about C# 3.0 and LINQ focus on the queries and LINQ to SQL, but I believe that using these functional techniques deserve some attention as well. This is why I'm very happy that my article about one of these techniques - representing lazy computations - is now available at the C# Developer Center. I would like to thank to &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/default.aspx"&gt;Charlie Calvert&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;], who is the Community Program Manager for C# and who edited and published my article there. Here is the annotation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;"&gt;Most of the programming languages used in practice (including for example C#, VB.NET, C++, Python or Java) employ so called eager evaluation, which means that the program evaluates all expression and statements in the order in which they are written, so all the preceding statements and expressions are evaluated before executing the next piece of code. This, for example, means that all arguments to a method call are evaluated before calling the method. Sometimes it may be useful to delay an execution of some code until the result is actually needed, either because the result may not be needed at all (but we can’t tell that before executing some computation) or because we don’t want to block the program for a long time by executing all computations in advance and instead we want to execute the computations later, when we will actually need the result. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:40px;margin-bottom:20px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;"&gt;In this article we will look how these lazy computations can be written in C# (using some of the new language features from version 3.0). We will first implement a Lazy class to represent this kind of computation, then look at a few simple examples to demonstrate how the class can be used, and finally we will examine one slightly more complicated, but practically useful application.

  First you can use the pure mode as I demonstrated in one of the earlier articles 
  on PHP application called Texy!. This approach can be used only for
  some specific applications, because pure mode has several restrictions - the two most important restrictions
  are that no global code or inclusions are allowed (you have to specify all source files during the
  compilation), but thanks to this restrictions Phalanger is able to produce classes that are compatible
  with .NET and can be called from C#. Second option is to create object dynamically by its name and
  perform all method invocations by name too. This approach can be used with any PHP scripts, but
  it isn't very convenient. In this article we present new features in the Phalanger beta 4 which 
  extend the second approach and make it possible to use objects from any PHP script in C# using 
  type-safe way.&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>Phalanger 2.0 Beta 4 available!</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/phalanger-beta4.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Apr 2007 16:24:09 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">This week we finished new release of the Phalanger project, what PHP applications are supported and what new features are available in this release?</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This week we finished new release of Phalanger (the PHP compiler for .NET platform). The goal in 
    this release was to fix many minor bugs preventing us from running some of the famous and 
    most often deployed open-source PHP applications, so with the new release you'll be able to 
    run for example &lt;strong&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/strong&gt;, the wiki application that evolved from system used 
    on Wikipedia or probably the best-known PHP blogging and publishing system &lt;strong&gt;WordPress&lt;/strong&gt;.
    Other applications that we tested can be found at Phalanger website in &lt;a href="http://php-compiler.net/doku.php?id=apps"&gt;the
    list of tested PHP applications&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://php-compiler.net/doku.php?id=apps" target="_blank"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;].
    Compatibility is very important for us, so if you have troubles running any open-source PHP application,
    let us know and we'll include it in our list!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that we focused on is interoperability between PHP scripts compiled using Phalanger 
    and other .NET languages. Using .NET objects from Phalanger is very intuitive and has almost no 
    limitations, however the other way is a bit difficult because of the dynamic nature of PHP language.
    If your PHP application can be compiled in the Phalanger &lt;strong&gt;pure&lt;/strong&gt; mode, than the
    PHP objects can be exported and made available to C# and other languages. The methods of objects 
    exported using this method take &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; (the base class for every .NET object) as 
    a parameter, because PHP checks types at runtime, so this may be a bit confusing for the users.
    In the Beta 4 we tried to target these two issues - first, the fact that you have to use pure mode
    and second, the fact that exported objects can't contain any information about accepted types.
    This is a topic for entire article, so I'll write about it soon... Stay tuned :-)!&lt;/p&gt;

  (or cores) in the computer at least for the close future. This causes a revolution in the way software is 
  written, because traditional and most widely used way of writing concurrent applications using
  threads is difficult and brings several serious issues. Some predictions say that within a few
  years, almost every computer will have about 16 cores, so there is a huge need for programming
  paradigms or idioms that help developers write concurrent software easily (see also &lt;a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm"&gt;The Free Lunch Is Over&lt;/a&gt; 
  [&lt;a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm" target="_blank"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;] written by Herb Sutter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional programming languages (especially pure functional languages) are interesting from 
  this point of view, because the program doesn't have side-effects which makes it very easy to 
  parallelize it (programs in pure functional languages can't have any side-effects by design, in other functional
  languages like F# the side-effects can be eliminated by following functional programming style). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article describes the code that makes it possible to parallelize some common F# constructs like the &lt;code&gt;List.map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;List.filter&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CLinq - LINQ support for the C++/CLI language</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/clinq-project.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2007 17:11:05 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">CLinq project is a library that makes it possible to use LINQ technologies from the C++/CLI language.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I started working on this project, because I attended C++ class at our university and I had to do some application in C++. Because I hate doing useless projects I wanted to work on something interesting and so I started thinking whether it would be possible to enable LINQ support in C++/CLI...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C++/CLI is a very flexible language and the following example proves that enabling LINQ support in C++/CLI isn't impossible. The following database query returns name of contact and company for all customers living in London:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre lang="c++"&gt;
// create connection to database
NorthwindData db(".. connection string ..");

// declare database query
Expr&amp;lt;Customers^&amp;gt; cvar = Var&amp;lt;Customers^&amp;gt;("c");
CQuery&amp;lt;String^&amp;gt;^ q = db.QCustomers
  -&amp;gt;Where(clq::fun(cvar, cvar.City == "London"))
  -&amp;gt;Select(clq::fun(cvar, 
      cvar.ContactName + Expr&amp;lt;String^&amp;gt;(", ") + cvar.CompanyName));

// execute query and output results
for each(String^ s in q-&amp;gt;Query)
  Console::WriteLine(s);

  This brings an interesting problem to Phalanger, because most of .NET languages support this and if we want to be able to call any .NET object
  from PHP we need to add support (at least) for calling of overloaded methods. The latest Phalanger release contains overload resolution described
  in the &lt;em&gt;Integrating PHP with CLR&lt;/em&gt; document [&lt;a href="#phpoverloadlnk"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when calling the &lt;code&gt;Console::WriteLine&lt;/code&gt; method (which has a lot of overloads), Phalanger dynamically generates 
  a piece of code that we call dynamic stub, which is responsible for choosing the most appropriate overload depending on the actual
  parameter types. This stub is generated only once for every method, which makes this implementation very efficient. The difficult part of 
  overload resolution is, how can the stub determine what is the best overload? PHP language has a lot of implicit conversions, so 
  when you pass the string &lt;code&gt;"10.2 Little Piggies"&lt;/code&gt; to a method it can be implicitly converted to float (&lt;code&gt;10.2&lt;/code&gt;) 
  (For more details see [&lt;a href="#phpoverloadlnk"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]). Another example of implicit conversion is that any boolean value can be 
  converted to string (empty string or string &lt;code&gt;"0"&lt;/code&gt; are converted to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, every other string is converted 
  to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;In this article I'll describe how does the dynamic stub look like in current version of Phalanger, what problems can it cause and how are we going to fix it in the future version!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Quotations Visualizer for F# 1.1.13.8</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/quotvis-1.1.13.8.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2007 23:35:03 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">Little update to my F# quotations visualizer tool to make it compatible with the latest version of F# (1.1.13.8).</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Quotation Visualizer is my tool that shows visual representation of F# quotations. Stephen noticed (Thanks!) that 
  Quotation Visualizer doesn't compile with the latest version of F# (1.1.13.8), so here is the updated version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="noindent"&gt;If you want to know more about this tool, here are links to previous articles about it:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/quotvis-reloaded.aspx"&gt;F# quotations visualizer - reloaded!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;  

&lt;h2&gt;What was wrong?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool is written using F# light syntax, which means that you don't have to write all the semicolons and
  F# compiler uses whitespace to determine end of the blocks (and some other constructs). This compiler option is
  relatively new so it is still evolving. First issue that I had is with class declaration - the following 
  code is not valid with the latest F# version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang="fsharp"&gt;
type MyForm = class inherit Form as base
  // ...
end
&lt;/pre&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I used it because it looks more familiar to C# developers :-). Instead of it you have to write the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang="fsharp"&gt;
type MyForm = class 
  inherit Form as base
  // ...
end
&lt;/pre&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The second issue was with the pipeline operator which is useful when working with lists (or other sequences). The 
  correct syntax for using pipeline operator (for expressions that are longer than one line) is following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang="fsharp"&gt;
let filteredList = 
       oldArray
    |&amp;gt; Array.to_list 
    |&amp;gt; List.map ( fun m -&amp;gt; /* ... */ ) 
    |&amp;gt; List.filter ( fun m -&amp;gt; /* ... */ )

Really?</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/cannot-return-anonymous-type-from-method.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2007 23:54:31 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">This article describes anonymous types - one of the new C# 3.0 features and shows interesting trick that can be used when returning anonymous type from method.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the new features introduced in C# 3.0 which will be available in Visual Studio "Orcas" (currently in CTP version) 
  is anonymous type. Anonymous type is something very similar to tuple type from Cω [&lt;a href="#returnanonymous"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] (which is based 
  on tuple types known from many functional programming languages including F#). Anonymous types are extremely useful in 
  LINQ queries, because it allows you to construct type with several properties without declaring the type (with all the properties).
  Example of query with anonymous type looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang="csharp"&gt;
var q = from c in db.Customers
        where c.Country = "Czech Republic"
        select new { FullName=c.Name+" "+c.Surname, Address=c.Address };
&lt;/pre&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Ok, it's probabbly not the best example, but it demonstrates the point - you want to return some information from query
  and you don't need to declare type that contains &lt;code&gt;FullName&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt; properties before, because
  you need it only for this single query (and you want to return only these two fields, so you don't transfer additional 
  data that you don't need from database).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let's get to the second point... &lt;/p&gt;

  [&lt;a href="http://php-compiler.net/" target="_blank"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;]. Phalanger was started as a project at Charles 
  University (where I'm studying) by Tomas Matousek, Ladislav Prosek and 4 other guys, the first version was
  very successful and they started wokring on the second version which introduces PHP in the family of first-class 
  .NET languages (which makes it fully interoperable with the rest of .NET world). After releasing the second 
  version, Tomas and Ladislav moved to Microsoft and convinced me to continue in the Phalanger development.
  Most of the work on the 2.0 version was already done, so we're currently working on implementing the 
  rest of the PHP/CLR language extensions, making Phalanger more compatible with existing PHP apps and so on.
  For more information about the history of Phalanger visit the &lt;a href="http://www.php-compiler.net/doku.php?id=core%3ahistory"&gt;project history page&lt;/a&gt;
  [&lt;a href="http://www.php-compiler.net/doku.php?id=core%3ahistory" target="_blank"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;I think that Phalanger is in the phase when it can be very interesting for both PHP and .NET communities, 
  but it never got greater publicity and there are not very much examples and articles to demonstrate
  the interesting Phalanger features. To improve this we started working on the new Phalanger website where
  users could share their experiences, tips etc. We used PHP wiki called &lt;a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki"&gt;DokuWiki&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki" target="_blank"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;] (running, of course on Phalanger)

  Because I spent quite a lot of time with puting the presentation together I wanted to make it available to wider 
  audience, so I translated the slides and examples to English (anyway, translating the content took me only a few minutes :-)).
  In case that some of the readers prefer Czech version, I attached the original documents too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the presentation I tried to introduce some basic concepts of functional programming (immutable values,
  lazy evaluation) to the audience with no experience with functional programming, as well as present some
  of the most interesting features of F# (like strict type system based on type inference, .NET interoperability and 
  metaprogramming). The whole contents of the presentation is following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional programming in F#&lt;/strong&gt; - Introduction to the F# type system&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some useful functional idioms&lt;/strong&gt; - How to do Foldl/Map/Filter functions and Lazy evaluation in C#&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactive scripting&lt;/strong&gt; - What is important for scripting, mathematical simulation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperability between F# and other .NET languages&lt;/strong&gt; - How to use .NET libraries from F# and F# libraries from ohter .NET languages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F# as a language for ASP.NET&lt;/strong&gt; - How to use F# as a language for ASP.NET development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta-programming in F#&lt;/strong&gt; - Meta-programming features in F# and the FLINQ project&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Downloads&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Presentation - &lt;a href="http://www.tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-presentation/fsharp-intro.ppt"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; (889 kB), &lt;a href="http://www.tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-presentation/fsharp-intro-en.ppt"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; (894 kB)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demos - &lt;a href="http://www.tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-presentation/demos.zip"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; (500 kB), &lt;a href="http://www.tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-presentation/demos-en.zip"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; (501 kB)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description></item><item><title>Concepts behind the C# 3.0 language</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp3-concepts.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2006 15:19:03 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">In this article I'll describe concepts that influenced the design of the C# 3.0.

Some of these features are known from functional languages (for example from LISP or Haskell), some other were developed at Microsoft Research and appeared in the F# language or Cω. I also wanted to show in what ways are these features limited in the C# 3.0.

  of program source code. If you're not familiar with quotations I recommend reading my 
  previous article [&lt;a href="#fsclassmeta-links"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] that contains short introduction
  to this topic first. Quotations can be used for example for translating subset of the F# language to 
  another code representation or another language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the quotation data of the expression you can either use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;@ .. @&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
  operator or &lt;code&gt;resolveTopDef&lt;/code&gt; function. In the first case the code written
  between the "&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;@&lt;/code&gt;" and "&lt;code&gt;@&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;" is converted to data during the compilation.
  The &lt;code&gt;resolveTopDef&lt;/code&gt; function allows you to get quotation data of top-level 
  definition (function) from compiled library at runtime (you have to use &lt;code&gt;--quotation-data&lt;/code&gt; 
  command line switch while compiling the library). I mentioned that quotations can be used to represent 
  only subset of the F# language. Currently, one of the quotation limitations is that it's not possible to 
  enclose the whole class in the quotation operators. It is also not possible to get the representation 
  of the whole class at runtime nor the representation of class members (for example methods). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article I'll present a simple method that makes it possible to use F# quotations for working with classes as well, however this is rather a prototype that can be used for experimenting and discovering areas where working with classes might be useful, not a fully working solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>F# quotations visualizer - reloaded!</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/quotvis-reloaded.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2006 21:39:06 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">New and improved version of quotation visualizer.

  This utility can be used to show visual representation of F# quotations, that can represent (subset of) source code written in F#.
  There are two ways that you can use to get F# quotations - first is using operators &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;@@ ... @@&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (this
  returns quotation of the code written inside the operator), second method is to get quotation of top level definition from compiled 
  F# assembly (you have to explicitly enable this using command line switch &lt;code&gt;--enable-quotation-data&lt;/code&gt; while compiling assembly).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I added several new features to the original Quotations visualizer, I decided to publish the latest version - here is the list of main improvements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewritten using active patterns (new F# language feature)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is possible to extract quotations from compiled F# assembly (if it contains quotation data)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added support for several missing language constructs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description></item><item><title>F# CodeDOM Provider on the CodePlex</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/codeplex-fsharp-codedom.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2006 00:13:46 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">CodeDOM generator for the F# language posted to the new Microsoft community site called CodePlex!</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;You probably already saw my post regarding CodeDOM generator for the F# language and how to use it with ASP.NET. To make it more accessible for everyone, I created project at the new Microsoft community site called &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com"&gt;CodePlex&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com" target="_blank"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To learn more about the project, visit &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=fscodedom"&gt;Project Home Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to send some comments, go to &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Project/ListForums.aspx?ProjectName=fscodedom"&gt;Discussion Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can also download latest source code - &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx?ProjectName=fscodedom"&gt;Latest Check-Ins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And finally, the latest releases can be found at the &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=fscodedom"&gt;Releases Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
BTW: CodePlex looks like a really good site. It is based on Visual Studio Team System (which means that developers of the project can do most of the work directly from Visual Studio). It provides management of "Work Items" (TODO list), source control and many other useful things! For example if you have any feature requests or bug requests, send them to the discussion and I can easilly create work item from the message in the discussions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you are interested in this project and you want to help with developing of some parts, or if you are working on a project that is related to CodeDOM and F#, please let me know. Any help or feedback is kindly welcome!

    for representing logical structure of .NET source code. These classes are used for generating Web service references
    (using &lt;code&gt;wsdl.exe&lt;/code&gt; tool), for generating typed datasets and in many other situations. The most interesting
    use of CodeDOM classes is in ASP.NET where ASP.NET generates code from &lt;code&gt;aspx&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ascx&lt;/code&gt; files and 
    compiles this code into web site assemblies (together with the code written in code behind files).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means, that you can use any language for developing ASP.NET web sites, as long as you implement CodeDOM provider
    that generates source code from CodeDOM structure and can compile these source files (this can be simply done by executing 
    command line compiler). 
I was recently working on CodeProvider for the F# language, and finally it supports everything
    what is needed by ASP.NET (however it is complete and it doesn't work for example with &lt;code&gt;wsdl.exe&lt;/code&gt;). Using this
    CodeDOM provider you can write ENTIRE web site in F# (including in-line code enclosed in &amp;lt;% ... source code ... %&amp;gt;).
    I also created project template for F# web site that can be imported to Visual Studio 2005, so you can easilly try 
    writing web pages in F#...&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>LINQ extensions - Simplified keyword search</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/linq-expand-update.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2006 03:57:38 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">Article describes LINQ extension that adds support for returning rows that contain any or all of specified keywords in string column.</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I came across interesting question at LINQ Forums (Dynamic conditions: How to achieve multiple "OR" conditions with LINQ? [&lt;a href="#updlq"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]).
  The question is whether LINQ (and especially LINQ to SQL) provides any simple way to return only records that contain one or more of 
  specified keywords in the name. The question looks simple, but it is simple only if you know the number of keywords that you want to 
  look for. In this case you can write following LINQ query:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;// Products that contain "kwd1" or "kwd2" in the name &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; q = &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; p &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; db.Products
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; p.ProductName.Contains("kwd1") || p.ProductName.Contains("kwd2")
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; p;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with previous code is that you can't use it if the list of keywords is dynamically entered by user
  (and so its length may vary). Of course, if you want to run query on in-memory data, you can get very nice results by
  writing extension method called &lt;code&gt;ContainsAny&lt;/code&gt; that performs test for keyword array, but if you 
  want to be able to translate query to SQL, the situation is a bit complicated.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>F# quotations visualizer</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/quotvis.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2006 02:20:03 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">Application that displays graphical representation of given F# quotation (using Windows Forms TreeView control)</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I already &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsquotations.aspx"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; what F# quotations are

  an extension to .NET Framework and most important .NET languages (C# and VB.Net) that extends these languages with query operators and some 
  language features that make it possible to integrate queries in the languages. Thanks to LINQ you can write queries that read data from database
  (or any other data source). For example, imagine that you want to write set of queries for eshop and you need to perform a price calculation
  in more queries. The problem with LINQ queries is that you can't simply call a function written in C# that calculates price. The following example
  is NOT WORKING for this reason:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;// function used in filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt; CalcPrice(Nwind.Product p)
{
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; p.UnitPrice * 1.19m;
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;// query that uses MyFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; q = 
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; p &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; db.Products
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; CalcPrice(p) &amp;gt; 30m
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; p
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that this is a big limitation, because when you want to keep some more complex logic in the data access layer you should be able to reuse 
  parts of queries that are similar across more queries. The good thing is that with latest release, LINQ became extensible so it is possible
  to write a extensions that allow this scenario...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can also &lt;a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/linq-expand/linq-expand.pdf"&gt;download the article in PDF&lt;/a&gt; (80kB)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description></item><item><title>Slides and demos from F# presentation</title><link>http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-slides-and-demos.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2006 21:14:39 GMT</pubDate><eex:summary xmlns:eex="http://tomasp.net/rss/extensions">I did a F# presentation at .NET seminar at our university, so here are the slides and demos...</eex:summary><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/">Tomas Petricek</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This semester I attended Advanced .NET Seminar that was led by &lt;a href="http://tmd.havit.cz/"&gt;Tomas Matousek&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://tmd.havit.cz/" target="_blank"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;] who is one of the authors of &lt;a href="http://www.php-compiler.net"&gt;Phalanger project&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://www.php-compiler.net" target="_blank"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;] (Which is an amazing project by the way.

  can get tree representation of the quoted expression. This allows you
  to write code that takes code written in F# as data and performs some
  code analysis or compiles/translates that code to different language.
  This is very similar to the new C# 3.0 expression trees where you can 
  get expression tree from lambda expression and translate this tree 
  for example to SQL (using DLINQ). However expression trees in C# 3.0 
  are very limited when compared with F# quotations, so that's one of

First I tried simple solution using &lt;code&gt;String.IndexOf&lt;/code&gt; and using &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt;, but none of these solutions was very suitable for this problem, so I decided to implement Aho-Corasick algorithm which is probabbly the best algorithm for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article (published here an on CodeProject.com) describes implementation of this algorithm for pattern matching. In simple words this algorithm can be used for searching text for specified keywords. This implementation is usefull when you have a set of keywords and you want to find all occurences in text or check if any of the keywords is present in the text. You should use this algorithm especially if you have large number of keywords that don't change often, because in this case it is much more efficient than other algorithms that can be simply implemented using .NET class library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aho-Corasick search algorithm is very efficient if you want to find large number of keywords in the text, but if you want to search only for a few keywords it is better to use simple method using &lt;code&gt;String.IndexOf&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
